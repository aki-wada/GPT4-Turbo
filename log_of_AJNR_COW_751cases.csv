2023,Absence of the Left Meckel Cave with Trigeminal Neuropathy,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 34-year-old woman with unilateral facial numbness and the imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12282023, here are five differential diagnoses:

1. Trigeminal neuropathy - The numbness could be due to a lesion affecting the trigeminal nerve.
2. Schwannoma (trigeminal nerve) - A benign tumor of the nerve sheath that can cause compression and subsequent numbness.
3. Multiple sclerosis (MS) - Can present with cranial nerve symptoms, including facial numbness, due to demyelination.
4. Microvascular compression - Compression of the trigeminal nerve, often by a blood vessel, can lead to facial numbness.
5. Sarcoidosis or other granulomatous diseases - These can involve the cranial nerves and lead to neuropathy.

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional information from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12282023/tab-legends, which describes Meckel cave asymmetry with a collapsed appearance on the left side and thinning/reduced dimensions of the left trigeminal nerve without abnormal enhancement or focal lesion, the differential diagnoses would be revised as follows:

1. Trigeminal nerve atrophy - The imaging findings suggest atrophy or chronic damage to the left trigeminal nerve.
2. Previous inflammatory or infectious process - Such as a prior episode of herpes zoster or other viral infection that could have caused nerve damage.
3. Trigeminal schwannoma - Although no focal lesion is seen, a history of schwannoma could have led to atrophy.
4. Tolosa-Hunt syndrome - An idiopathic granulomatous inflammation of the cavernous sinus or Meckel cave, which can cause cranial nerve deficits.
5. Idiopathic trigeminal neuropathy - A diagnosis of exclusion when other causes are ruled out.

Confidence Level: 85%

The absence of a focal lesion or abnormal enhancement makes neoplastic causes less likely, and the lack of typical CSF content in the left Meckel cave along with the asymmetry and thinning of the trigeminal nerve suggests a chronic or previous process affecting the nerve. The specific cause of the trigeminal nerve atrophy would require further clinical correlation and possibly additional testing, such as laboratory workup for inflammatory or infectious conditions.",70,Insufficient
2023,Acute Lenticulostriate Artery Infarct with Branch Atheromatous Disease (BAD),"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05042023, a 59-year-old man with no known medical illness presents with acute onset of right-sided body weakness and numbness, and MRI shows acute infarct of the left basal ganglia with evidence of DWI and FLAIR mismatch. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Ischemic stroke due to small vessel disease - Confidence level: 90%
2. Ischemic stroke due to cardioembolism - Confidence level: 70%
3. Ischemic stroke due to large artery atherosclerosis - Confidence level: 80%
4. Hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic stroke - Confidence level: 60%
5. Lacunar infarct - Confidence level: 85%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05042023/tab-legends, which describe hyperintensity at the left basal ganglia on DWI with no corresponding hyperintensity on FLAIR (DWI-FLAIR mismatch), and black-blood vessel wall imaging (VWI) showing luminal hyperintensity outlining the left lenticulostriate artery and atherosclerotic plaque within the left MCA at the origin of the lenticulostriate artery, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Branch atheromatous disease - Confidence level: 95%
2. Cardioembolic stroke - Confidence level: 70%
3. Lacunar infarct secondary to lipohyalinosis - Confidence level: 75%
4. Small vessel occlusion due to other vasculopathies (e.g., vasculitis) - Confidence level: 65%
5. Hypercoagulable state leading to small vessel occlusion - Confidence level: 60%

The imaging findings, particularly the VWI sequence showing atherosclerotic plaque at the origin of the lenticulostriate artery and the DWI-FLAIR mismatch, are highly suggestive of branch atheromatous disease, which is a small vessel disease due to atherosclerosis of the penetrating arteries. This is consistent with the acute infarct in the left basal ganglia and the clinical presentation of right-sided weakness and numbness. The high confidence level reflects the specific imaging findings that correlate with this diagnosis. Other causes of ischemic stroke are still possible but less likely given the imaging characteristics. Further clinical evaluation, including vascular studies and possibly cardiac monitoring, would be appropriate to fully assess the etiology of the stroke and guide treatment.",90,Excellent
2023,Atypical Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome with Spinal Cord Involvement (PRES-SCI),"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01052023, a young woman presents with one month of blurry vision and intermittent headaches, hypertension (BP 230/130), fundoscopic examination showing bilateral blurred disc margins, cotton wool spots, macular edema, mild arteriole attenuation, hemorrhages, and choroidal infarcts, poor visual acuity, red color desaturation, and symmetric hyperreflexia. Initial blood tests reveal elevated BUN and creatinine, while all serum autoimmune tests and CSF are normal. She improves after treatment. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Malignant hypertension with hypertensive encephalopathy - Confidence level: 95%
2. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) - Confidence level: 90%
3. Renal artery stenosis leading to secondary hypertension and end-organ damage - Confidence level: 80%
4. Collagen vascular disease (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus) - Confidence level: 70%
5. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) - Confidence level: 65%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01052023/tab-legends, which describe FLAIR hyperintense and BRAVO hypointense signal abnormality in the pons, medulla, and cervical spinal cord, an expanded spinal cord with central hyperintensity extending to T3 from the brainstem, no restricted diffusion on ADC map, and resolution of the hyperintense signal at 3-month follow-up, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) - Confidence level: 95%
2. Central nervous system vasculitis - Confidence level: 85%
3. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) - Confidence level: 80%
4. Multiple sclerosis - Confidence level: 75%
5. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) - Confidence level: 70%

The imaging findings, clinical presentation, and the resolution of symptoms after treatment are highly suggestive of PRES, which is often associated with severe hypertension and can show reversible signal changes on MRI. The lack of restricted diffusion and the improvement over time without contrast imaging due to acute kidney injury (AKI) support this diagnosis. Other inflammatory or demyelinating diseases such as ADEM, multiple sclerosis, or NMOSD are also possible but less likely given the clinical context and the rapid improvement. The high confidence level for PRES reflects the typical imaging findings and the association with severe hypertension and renal impairment.",95,Excellent
2023,Autoimmune Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein Astrocytopathy,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03302023, a 48-year-old woman presents with fever for 10 days followed by acute-onset confusion, tetraparesis, and urinary retention, with lumbar puncture showing aseptic lymphocytic meningitis. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Viral encephalitis - Confidence level: 80%
2. Autoimmune encephalitis - Confidence level: 75%
3. Multiple sclerosis - Confidence level: 70%
4. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) - Confidence level: 65%
5. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) - Confidence level: 60%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03302023/tab-legends, which describe linear radial periventricular enhancement, mild hyperintensities in the basal ganglia and thalami, longitudinally extensive myelitis with diffuse intramedullary hyperintensities, diffuse intramedullary enhancement, leptomeningeal and periependymal enhancement, and a cystic parauterine lesion consistent with a mature ovarian teratoma, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis associated with teratoma - Confidence level: 90%
2. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) - Confidence level: 85%
3. Autoimmune encephalitis (e.g., anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis) - Confidence level: 80%
4. Viral encephalomyelitis - Confidence level: 70%
5. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) - Confidence level: 65%

The presence of a mature ovarian teratoma raises the possibility of a paraneoplastic syndrome, such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, which can present with encephalitis, myelitis, and ovarian teratomas. The imaging findings of periventricular enhancement, basal ganglia and thalamic hyperintensities, and longitudinally extensive myelitis are consistent with this diagnosis. NMOSD is also a consideration given the longitudinally extensive myelitis and periependymal enhancement, but the presence of the teratoma makes a paraneoplastic syndrome more likely. The high confidence level for paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis reflects the specific clinical and imaging findings in the context of the ovarian teratoma. Further evaluation, including testing for specific autoantibodies, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.",65,Insufficient
2023,Blunt Cerebrovascular Injury _ Denver Grade III (Pseudoaneurysm),"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05252023, a 52-year-old man presents with headache and left-sided ptosis, miosis, and facial anesthesia (Horner syndrome) after skiing and coughing. Given these clinical features, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Carotid artery dissection
2. Cluster headache
3. Cerebral aneurysm
4. Pancoast tumor
5. Stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05252023/tab-legends, which describe imaging findings such as a focal saccular outpouching of contrast (pseudoaneurysm) and surrounding soft tissue (intramural hematoma) in the left distal cervical internal carotid artery (ICA), the differential diagnoses can be revised. The imaging findings are consistent with a carotid artery dissection. The revised differential diagnosis with a focus on the imaging findings would be:

1. Carotid artery dissection (primary diagnosis based on imaging findings) - Confidence level: 95%
2. Cerebral aneurysm (less likely given the described imaging findings) - Confidence level: 5%
3. Other vascular abnormalities (e.g., fibromuscular dysplasia, vasculitis) - Confidence level: 5%
4. Neoplastic causes (e.g., head and neck cancers causing secondary vascular compromise) - Confidence level: 5%
5. Traumatic injury to the neck vessels (less likely given the clinical context) - Confidence level: 5%

The high confidence level for carotid artery dissection is due to the specific imaging findings described, such as the presence of a pseudoaneurysm and intramural hematoma, which are characteristic of this condition. The other conditions are less likely based on the provided imaging description but are included as part of a comprehensive differential diagnosis.",95,Good
2023,Branchio-Oto-Renal Syndrome,"Based on the summary of the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03232023, a 37-year-old man with a history of end-stage renal disease presents with worsening hearing loss. The CT images of the right temporal bone show an unwound cochlea, hypoplastic apical and middle turns, a dysmorphic vestibular apparatus with incomplete formation of the posterior semicircular canal, a patulous Eustachian tube, an abnormally inferior course of the tympanic segment of the facial nerve, a stenotic oval window with nonvisualization of the stapes, and bony uncovering of the superior semicircular canal.

Given this information, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Congenital inner ear malformations (e.g., Mondini dysplasia)
2. Otosclerosis
3. Superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome
4. Chronic otitis media with ossicular chain abnormalities
5. Renal osteodystrophy affecting the temporal bone

After reviewing the detailed imaging findings provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03232023/tab-legends, the differential diagnoses can be revised to focus on conditions that would account for the specific abnormalities described:

1. Congenital inner ear malformations (e.g., Mondini dysplasia) - Confidence level: 90%
2. Superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome - Confidence level: 70%
3. Renal osteodystrophy affecting the temporal bone (given the patient's history of end-stage renal disease) - Confidence level: 60%
4. Syndromic associations (e.g., CHARGE syndrome, Pendred syndrome) that may present with such anomalies - Confidence level: 50%
5. Trauma or prior surgery leading to secondary changes in the temporal bone - Confidence level: 40%

The high confidence level for congenital inner ear malformations is due to the unwound cochlea and other dysmorphic features of the vestibular apparatus, which are characteristic of such conditions. The other diagnoses are considered based on the combination of clinical history and imaging findings but are less likely given the described abnormalities.",90,Insufficient
2023,Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma (CXPA) of the orbit arising from the lacrimal gland,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06082023, a 32-year-old man presents with left eye swelling, tearing, and redness that started 7 months ago. Without specific diagnostic imaging findings or clinical details, here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Orbital cellulitis
2. Dacryoadenitis (inflammation of the lacrimal gland)
3. Orbital pseudotumor (idiopathic orbital inflammation)
4. Lacrimal gland tumor (benign or malignant)
5. Thyroid eye disease (Graves' ophthalmopathy)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06082023/tab-legends, which include a CT bone reconstruction showing smooth bony remodeling and periosteal reaction of the adjacent zygoma, an avidly enhancing mass arising from the lacrimal gland, and other specific imaging characteristics such as a hyperintense lesion on DWI with corresponding low ADC signal, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Lacrimal gland neoplasm (e.g., adenoid cystic carcinoma, pleomorphic adenoma) - Given the enhancing mass arising from the lacrimal gland and the presence of bone remodeling, a neoplasm is a strong consideration.
2. Lymphoma - Can present as an enhancing mass, although it typically has less aggressive bone involvement.
3. Sarcoidosis - Can cause lacrimal gland enlargement and bone changes, but other systemic findings would be expected.
4. Inflammatory pseudotumor - Usually presents with less well-defined borders and may not enhance as avidly.
5. Infectious process (e.g., bacterial abscess) - Less likely given the duration of symptoms and imaging characteristics, but cannot be completely ruled out without further clinical correlation.

Confidence level: 80%

The confidence level reflects the likelihood that the revised differential diagnosis fits the imaging findings described. However, a definitive diagnosis would require correlation with clinical history, examination, laboratory results, and potentially a biopsy.",80,Good
2023,Cerebellar Dural Arteriovenous Fistula,"Based on the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07062023, a 70-year-old man presents with fatigue and progressive gait difficulty. Without specific imaging findings, here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH)
2. Vascular dementia
3. Parkinson's disease
4. Multiple system atrophy (MSA)
5. Cerebellar ataxia due to various etiologies (e.g., degenerative, inflammatory, neoplastic)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07062023/tab-legends, which describe several tortuous flow voids in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres, blooming on SWI sequence, and fistulous connections involving branches of the superior cerebellar artery and the left occipital artery with deep cerebellar veins, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) - The imaging findings of tortuous flow voids and fistulous connections are highly suggestive of a DAVF.
2. Cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) - Similar imaging findings to DAVF, but the description seems more consistent with a fistula.
3. Cerebellar hemorrhage - The SWI blooming could suggest previous hemorrhage, which can be associated with vascular malformations.
4. Brainstem/cerebellar stroke - Vascular abnormalities can lead to ischemic events, although the described findings are more specific for vascular malformations.
5. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) - While CAA can present with microbleeds that may show blooming on SWI, the presence of fistulous connections is not characteristic of CAA.

Confidence level: 95%

The confidence level is high because the imaging findings described are quite characteristic of a vascular malformation, most likely a dural arteriovenous fistula, which fits well with the patient's presentation of progressive gait difficulty and the imaging findings of abnormal vascular connections and flow voids.",95,Excellent
2023,Cerebral Nocardiosis,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11092023, a 30-year-old woman with retroviral serology positive presents with a history of progressive ameliorating headache for 1 month and multiple episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) since the last week. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. HIV-associated opportunistic infections such as toxoplasmosis or cryptococcal meningitis.
2. Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), which can be associated with immunocompromised states.
3. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a demyelinating disease caused by the JC virus in immunocompromised individuals.
4. Cerebral abscess, which can occur in patients with compromised immune systems.
5. Tuberculous meningitis or CNS tuberculosis, which can present with similar symptoms in patients with HIV.

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11092023/tab-legends, which describe multiple well-encapsulated collections with internal T2-hyperintense contents and alternative layering of T2-hypo/hyperintense wall, as well as the ""dual rim sign"" on susceptibility-weighted imaging, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Cerebral toxoplasmosis - The ""dual rim sign"" is highly suggestive of this diagnosis in an HIV-positive patient.
2. Neurocysticercosis - Can present with cystic lesions and surrounding edema, but less likely in the context of retroviral serology positivity.
3. Bacterial brain abscess - The encapsulated collections and diffusion restriction are consistent with abscesses, but the ""dual rim sign"" is more specific for toxoplasmosis.
4. Tuberculous brain abscess - Can present with ring-enhancing lesions, but the imaging characteristics are more typical of toxoplasmosis.
5. Primary CNS lymphoma - While it can present with ring-enhancing lesions in HIV-positive patients, the imaging findings described are less typical for PCNSL.

Confidence level: 90%

The confidence level is high because the imaging findings, particularly the ""dual rim sign,"" are characteristic of cerebral toxoplasmosis, which is a common opportunistic infection in patients with HIV/AIDS. The clinical presentation of headaches and seizures further supports this diagnosis. However, definitive diagnosis would require further clinical correlation and possibly biopsy or response to empirical treatment.",90,Insufficient
2023,"CHANTER (Cerebellar, Hippocampal, and Basal Nuclei Transient Edema with Restricted Diffusion) Syndrome","Based on the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02162023, a 59-year-old man with no pertinent past medical history presents to the emergency department after being found unresponsive, presumed secondary to opioid ingestion. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for his presentation:

1. Opioid overdose leading to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy
2. Acute ischemic stroke
3. Intracranial hemorrhage
4. Metabolic encephalopathy (e.g., hypoglycemia, hepatic or uremic encephalopathy)
5. Non-convulsive status epilepticus

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02162023/tab-legends, which describe patchy areas of hypoattenuation in both cerebellar hemispheres, diffuse restricted diffusion throughout both cerebellar hemispheres as well as involving both hippocampi, and additional areas of restricted diffusion involving the posterior left temporal and left occipital cortex, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Bilateral cerebellar infarcts with possible involvement of the posterior cerebral artery territory
2. Global hypoxic-ischemic injury, particularly if there was a prolonged period of hypoxia or anoxia
3. Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), given the involvement of the temporal lobes and hippocampi
4. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), although less likely given the imaging pattern
5. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), which can present with rapidly progressive neurological decline and diffusion restriction in the cortex and deep gray matter structures

Confidence level: 75%

The confidence level reflects the complexity of the case and the need for further clinical correlation and possibly additional diagnostic tests, such as cerebrospinal fluid analysis or EEG, to narrow down the diagnosis. The imaging findings suggest a multifocal process with both cerebellar and cerebral involvement, which is not typical for a single straightforward diagnosis.",75,Insufficient
2023,Congenital Neuropathic Strabismus Due to Bilateral Third Cranial Nerve Hypoplasia/Aplasia,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11162023, a 9-year-old boy presents for evaluation of recurrent exotropia and bilateral ptosis. He had difficulty opening his eyes at birth and underwent multiple ptosis repair and muscle surgeries. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Congenital myasthenic syndrome
2. Congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles
3. Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy
4. Myotonic dystrophy
5. Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11162023/tab-legends, which describe the absence of cranial nerve III bilaterally, hypoplasia of the extraocular muscles (particularly the superior recti), and divergent strabismus, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Congenital cranial dysinnervation disorder (CCDD), such as congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles, given the absence of cranial nerve III and muscle hypoplasia.
2. Duane retraction syndrome, which can be associated with extraocular muscle hypoplasia and eye movement abnormalities, although typically involves the abducens nerve.
3. Moebius syndrome, a condition that involves congenital facial and abducens nerve palsy, which could explain the ptosis and strabismus.
4. Congenital myopathies, which may present with hypoplasia of the extraocular muscles and ptosis.
5. Congenital myasthenic syndrome, which can cause ptosis and ophthalmoplegia, although the absence of cranial nerve III and muscle hypoplasia would be less typical.

Confidence level: 85%

The confidence level is relatively high because the imaging findings of absent cranial nerve III and hypoplasia of the extraocular muscles strongly suggest a congenital cranial dysinnervation disorder. The clinical history of ptosis since birth and multiple surgeries for strabismus support a congenital etiology. However, without genetic testing or further clinical details, it is not possible to definitively diagnose the specific type of CCDD.",85,Good
2023,Currarino Syndrome (Incomplete Variant),"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10262023, a 61-year-old man presents with bilateral lumbosacral plexopathy for 1 year. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for his presentation:

1. Diabetic amyotrophy
2. Lumbosacral radiculopathy, possibly due to degenerative disc disease or spinal stenosis
3. Neoplastic infiltration of the lumbosacral plexus
4. Inflammatory/autoimmune plexopathy, such as from an autoimmune condition like chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP)
5. Infectious causes, such as herpes zoster or cytomegalovirus (CMV) in immunocompromised patients

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10262023/tab-legends, which describe an anterior sacral meningocele, a presacral epidermoid cyst with restricted diffusion, a low-lying tethered cord with a tiny filar lipoma, and a scimitar sacrum, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Anterior sacral meningocele - Confirmed by imaging with the presence of a meningocele.
2. Presacral epidermoid cyst - Confirmed by imaging with characteristic signal intensity and restricted diffusion.
3. Tethered cord syndrome - Confirmed by imaging with a low-lying conus medullaris and associated filar lipoma.
4. Cauda equina syndrome - Although not directly visualized, the presence of a meningocele and tethered cord could contribute to cauda equina-like symptoms.
5. Sacral dysgenesis - Evidenced by the scimitar sacrum and associated congenital anomalies.

Confidence level: 100%

The confidence level is 100% for the revised differential diagnosis because the imaging findings described are pathognomonic for the conditions listed, and they directly explain the patient's presentation of bilateral lumbosacral plexopathy. The imaging findings are specific and leave little room for alternative diagnoses.",100,Excellent
2023,"Extra-axial medulloblastoma, SHH-activated subtype","Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10122023, a 30-year-old woman presents with headaches for the past 6 months. Without specific imaging findings, here are five initial differential diagnoses for chronic headaches:

1. Migraine
2. Tension-type headache
3. Cluster headache
4. Medication overuse headache
5. Secondary headache due to a structural lesion, such as a brain tumor or vascular malformation

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10122023/tab-legends, which describe an extra-axial mass centered along the left tentorium with diffusion restriction, ill-defined mass on T2, T2/FLAIR hyperintensity with mild extension into the left cerebellar hemisphere, and heterogeneous enhancement post-contrast, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Meningioma - Common extra-axial tumors that can show heterogeneous enhancement and are often found along the tentorium.
2. Hemangiopericytoma - A vascular tumor that can appear similar to meningioma but often has a more aggressive behavior and can show diffusion restriction.
3. Dural metastasis - Secondary tumors that can involve the dura and may present with heterogeneous enhancement and diffusion restriction.
4. Lymphoma - Can involve the dura and present as an extra-axial mass with diffusion restriction and variable enhancement.
5. Solitary fibrous tumor/hemangiopericytoma - These can present as extra-axial dural-based masses with aggressive features and heterogeneous enhancement.

Confidence level: 80%

The confidence level is relatively high because the imaging findings suggest a dural-based extra-axial mass with characteristics that are more typical of neoplastic processes such as meningioma or metastasis. However, without histopathological confirmation, there remains a degree of uncertainty, and other less common entities cannot be completely excluded.",80,Insufficient
2023,Extrapontine Diffuse Midline Glioma,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02022023, an 11-year-old boy presents with a 2-week history of nausea and vomiting. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Gastroenteritis
2. Intracranial mass or tumor
3. Migraine or headache disorder
4. Appendicitis or another abdominal condition
5. Central nervous system (CNS) infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02022023/tab-legends, which describe an infiltrative, expansile mass centered in the left thalamus with T2-FLAIR hyperintensity, areas of mild internal restricted diffusion, and no postcontrast enhancement, extending inferiorly into the left eccentric midbrain and causing obstructive hydrocephalus, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Low-grade glioma, such as pilocytic astrocytoma or diffuse astrocytoma, given the T2-FLAIR hyperintensity and lack of enhancement.
2. Gliomatosis cerebri, due to the infiltrative nature of the mass.
3. Lymphoma, which can present as an infiltrative brain lesion, although it typically enhances after contrast administration.
4. Inflammatory or demyelinating lesion, such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), which can present with similar imaging features in children.
5. Thalamic stroke, which can cause T2 hyperintensity and restricted diffusion, but would be less likely to present as an expansile mass.

Confidence level: 75%

The confidence level is set at 75% because the imaging characteristics suggest a neoplastic process, and the lack of enhancement may indicate a low-grade tumor. However, the differential diagnosis for pediatric brain tumors is broad, and the exact histological diagnosis would require further investigation, including potentially a biopsy. The presence of obstructive hydrocephalus and the mass effect on the midbrain are concerning and warrant urgent attention.",75,Good
2023,Focal Cortical Dysplasia Type II,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06152023, a 24-year-old woman has been experiencing right frontal focal epilepsy since the age of 12, with an increase in seizure frequency recently. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for her condition:

1. Focal cortical dysplasia
2. Low-grade glioma or ganglioglioma
3. Arteriovenous malformation (AVM)
4. Epidermoid cyst
5. Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06152023/tab-legends, which describe asymmetry of the normal sulcation/gyration pattern of the parasagittal high frontal region with a deep supernumerary sulcus on the right, no changes in the normal thickness or signal of the cortex or adjacent white matter, and areas of interictal hypometabolism adjacent to the supernumerary right frontal sulcus on FDG-PET/MRI coregistration, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type II - The imaging findings, including the supernumerary sulcus and the interictal hypometabolism, along with the electroencephalographic pattern, are highly suggestive of FCD type II.
2. Other malformations of cortical development - Given the abnormal sulcation, other cortical malformations could be considered, but the specific findings favor FCD.
3. Low-grade epilepsy-associated tumors - Such as DNET or ganglioglioma, which can be associated with epilepsy but may show more distinct imaging characteristics.
4. Gliosis or post-inflammatory scarring - Which can result from chronic epilepsy but would not typically present with the described sulcal pattern.
5. Vascular malformation - Less likely given the lack of signal changes or enhancement, but could be considered in the broader differential for seizures.

Confidence level: 95%

The confidence level is high because the imaging findings and clinical presentation are characteristic of focal cortical dysplasia, particularly type II, which is a common cause of drug-resistant epilepsy. The description of the imaging findings, including the MRI and FDG-PET/MRI coregistration, along with the SEEG confirmation of an epileptogenic focus, strongly supports this diagnosis.",96,Excellent
2023,Fungal Abscess,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 28-year-old man with diabetes, right-sided nasal obstruction for 3 months, followed by right-sided headache for 1 month, and a seizure, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Fungal sinusitis (e.g., mucormycosis, especially given the patient's diabetic status)
2. Nasal polyps with secondary sinusitis
3. Invasive bacterial sinusitis
4. Sinonasal carcinoma
5. Antrochoanal polyp

Confidence Level: 60% - This confidence level reflects the consideration of common causes of nasal obstruction and headache in a diabetic patient, but without specific imaging findings, it is a broad differential.

After reviewing the imaging findings from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06292023/tab-legends), which describes a well-defined, round, hypointense lesion with a thick, hyperintense rim in the right medial temporal lobe, hyperintensity in the center of the lesion with a hypointense margin, extensive perilesional edema, blooming on SWI, diffusion restriction, ring enhancement on postcontrast images, and a characteristic trehalose peak on MR spectroscopy, the differential diagnoses can be revised to include:

1. Cerebral abscess (possibly fungal given the trehalose peak, which is characteristic of fungi like Cryptococcus)
2. High-grade glioma with central necrosis
3. Metastatic lesion
4. Lymphoma
5. Tuberculoma

Confidence Level: 80% - This confidence level is higher because the differential diagnoses are now based on specific imaging characteristics that are more suggestive of certain pathologies, particularly the presence of a trehalose peak which is indicative of a fungal etiology.

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06292023/tab-legends-2), which shows hyperintense mucosal thickening in the right maxillary sinus, the differential diagnosis can be further refined:

1. Fungal sinusitis with intracranial extension (e.g., mucormycosis or aspergillosis)
2. Invasive bacterial sinusitis with secondary brain abscess
3. Sinonasal carcinoma with intracranial extension
4. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's granulomatosis) with secondary infection
5. Chronic granulomatous disease with infection

Confidence Level: 90% - The confidence level is increased because the combination of sinus and intracranial findings in a diabetic patient strongly suggests an invasive process, with fungal etiology being particularly concerning. The specific imaging features and clinical context guide the differential towards a likely infectious cause with possible fungal origin.",90,Excellent
2023,Ganglioglioma,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 5-year-old with headaches, vomiting, and visual disorders, and without specific imaging findings, here are five general differential diagnoses:

1. Medulloblastoma
2. Ependymoma
3. Astrocytoma (including pilocytic astrocytoma)
4. Brainstem glioma
5. Arachnoid cyst

Confidence Level: 60% - This confidence level reflects the common pediatric posterior fossa tumors that could present with these symptoms, but without imaging, it is a broad differential.

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08312023/tab-legends), which describes a mass in the posterior cerebral fossa of vermian origin with cystic components and mural tissue nodules, diffusion restriction with low ADC values, postcontrast enhancement of the nodules, and additional leptomeningeal nodular enhancement, the differential diagnoses can be revised to include:

1. Medulloblastoma
2. Ependymoma
3. Pilocytic astrocytoma
4. Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT)
5. Hemangioblastoma

Confidence Level: 85% - This confidence level is higher because the differential diagnoses are now based on specific imaging characteristics that are more suggestive of certain pediatric posterior fossa tumors. Medulloblastoma, in particular, is known for its tendency to spread via CSF pathways, which could explain the leptomeningeal enhancement. However, without histopathological confirmation, the confidence level cannot be 100%.",85,Insufficient
2023,Glutaric Aciduria Type 1 with Subependymal Nodules,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11022023, a 23-year-old man presents with a history of severe dystonia since childhood and is admitted for lumbar drain placement for intrathecal baclofen administration. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for severe dystonia:

1. Primary dystonia (e.g., DYT1)
2. Wilson's disease
3. Huntington's disease
4. Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN)
5. Cerebral palsy

Confidence Level: 60%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11022023/tab-legends, which describes widened bilateral Sylvian fissures, prominence of CSF spaces along the anterior temporal lobes bilaterally with hypoplasia of the bilateral anterior temporal lobes, bilateral basal ganglia T2 hyperintensity, volume loss involving the caudate and lentiform nuclei, chronic mild dilation of the lateral ventricles, and multiple subependymal nodules that are hyperintense on FLAIR and T2-weighted images and isointense on T1-weighted images with no enhancement post IV contrast injection, the differential diagnoses would be revised to consider:

1. Tuberous sclerosis complex (given the subependymal nodules)
2. Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) (given the basal ganglia hyperintensity)
3. Lysosomal storage diseases (e.g., Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease)
4. Mitochondrial disorders (e.g., Leigh syndrome)
5. Secondary dystonia due to a structural abnormality or previous encephalitis

The imaging findings of subependymal nodules and basal ganglia changes are suggestive of a neurocutaneous syndrome such as tuberous sclerosis complex or a metabolic disorder like NBIA. The presence of these specific imaging findings significantly narrows the differential diagnosis.

Confidence Level: 85%

Please note that these differential diagnoses are based on the provided data and that actual clinical decision-making would require a thorough clinical evaluation and additional diagnostic testing.",85,Insufficient
2023,Hemangioblastoma,"Based on the summary of the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08102023, a 53-year-old man with a history of diabetes presents with swallowing and gait disorder and vertigo. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Brainstem stroke
2. Multiple sclerosis
3. Vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma)
4. Cerebellar tumor (e.g., astrocytoma, hemangioblastoma)
5. Inflammatory or infectious process (e.g., brainstem encephalitis, abscess)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08102023/tab-legends, which describe a heterogeneous T2 hyperintense intra-axial exophytic lesion of the right cerebellar hemisphere with associated parenchymal high T2 signal change, sparing the right internal auditory canal, and showing vascular flow voids at the periphery of the lesion, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Hemangioblastoma - Confidence level: 80%
2. Metastatic disease - Confidence level: 70%
3. High-grade glioma (e.g., glioblastoma) - Confidence level: 65%
4. Lymphoma - Confidence level: 60%
5. Cerebellar abscess - Confidence level: 50%

The presence of vascular flow voids at the periphery of the lesion and the pattern of enhancement on T1 contrast-enhanced images suggest a highly vascular lesion, which is characteristic of hemangioblastoma, especially in the cerebellum. However, the possibility of metastatic disease or a high-grade glioma should also be considered given the patient's age and the lesion's imaging characteristics. The sparing of the right internal auditory canal makes a vestibular schwannoma less likely. Definitive diagnosis would likely require further investigation, including a full clinical workup, additional imaging studies, and possibly biopsy or surgical intervention.",80,Excellent
2023,Hemiplegic Migraine Headache,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06012023, a 79-year-old woman presents with acute onset right-sided hemiplegia, gaze deviation, and receptive and expressive aphasia. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Ischemic stroke
2. Hemorrhagic stroke
3. Brain tumor causing mass effect
4. Subdural hematoma
5. Encephalitis

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06012023/tab-legends, which describe decreased cerebral blood flow throughout the left cerebral hemisphere on Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) imaging, no evidence of acute infarction on Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI), chronic microvascular ischemic changes on T2/FLAIR, and minor asymmetric prominent susceptibility artifact in the left cerebral sulci on Susceptibility Weighted Imaging (SWI), the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Acute ischemic stroke with hypoperfusion - Confidence level: 90%
2. Chronic microvascular ischemic disease - Confidence level: 80%
3. Migraine with aura (complicated migraine) - Confidence level: 50%
4. Seizure with postictal Todd's paralysis - Confidence level: 60%
5. Transient ischemic attack (TIA) - Confidence level: 70%

The absence of acute infarction on DWI despite the decreased cerebral blood flow on ASL suggests that there may not be an acute infarct, but rather a perfusion deficit that has not yet resulted in infarction. This could be consistent with a TIA or a stroke with hypoperfusion. The chronic microvascular ischemic changes on T2/FLAIR are common in the elderly population and may not fully explain the acute presentation. The minor asymmetric prominent susceptibility artifact in the left cerebral sulci could be related to chronic microvascular changes or previous small hemorrhages, but is less likely to be the cause of acute symptoms. Given the clinical presentation and imaging findings, acute ischemic stroke with hypoperfusion seems to be the most likely diagnosis, but further clinical correlation and follow-up imaging would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities.",90,Insufficient
2023,IgG4-Related Hypophysitis,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04132023, a 14-year-old adolescent girl presents with headache, weight loss, polyuria, and polydipsia, and laboratory workup demonstrates panhypopituitarism. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Pituitary adenoma
2. Craniopharyngioma
3. Langerhans cell histiocytosis
4. Germinoma
5. Inflammatory process (e.g., hypophysitis, sarcoidosis)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04132023/tab-legends, which describe abnormal thickening and enhancement of the infundibulum/hypothalamus, enlargement of the pituitary gland, absence of the normal posterior pituitary bright spot, paranasal sinus disease, and a large mass-like consolidation in the medial right upper lobe of the lung, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Germinoma - Confidence level: 85%
2. Langerhans cell histiocytosis - Confidence level: 80%
3. Sarcoidosis - Confidence level: 75%
4. Tuberculosis (involving the pituitary and lung) - Confidence level: 70%
5. Metastatic disease (less likely given the patient's age) - Confidence level: 50%

The combination of pituitary/hypothalamic thickening and enhancement, paranasal sinus disease, and a lung mass is suggestive of a systemic disease that can affect multiple organ systems. Germinoma is a type of tumor that can present with diabetes insipidus, pituitary dysfunction, and central nervous system involvement, making it a strong consideration. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is another systemic disease that can involve the pituitary as well as the lungs and sinuses. Sarcoidosis and tuberculosis are granulomatous diseases that can also present with multi-system involvement and similar imaging findings. The improvement in the pituitary and infundibulum after 2 weeks of appropriate treatment suggests a responsive condition, which could be consistent with an infectious or inflammatory process. Further clinical correlation, laboratory testing, and potentially biopsy would be required to reach a definitive diagnosis.",85,Insufficient
2023,Intracranial Temporomandibular Joint Synovial/Ganglion Cyst,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02232023, a 62-year-old woman presents with several weeks of progressive left-sided facial pain. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Trigeminal neuralgia
2. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder
3. Malignant tumor involving the facial nerve
4. Benign tumor of the cranial nerves (e.g., schwannoma, meningioma)
5. Herpes zoster oticus (Ramsay Hunt syndrome)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02232023/tab-legends, which describe a rim-enhancing lesion in the left middle cranial fossa with mass effect on the temporal lobe, intrinsic T1 shortening centrally that could reflect intralesional hemorrhage, central fluid signal on T2-weighted image without adjacent parenchymal edema, linear enhancement extending from the lesion to the glenoid fossa, enhancement around both temporomandibular joints likely representing synovitis, and an osseous defect between the mass and the glenoid fossa, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Chondrosarcoma - Confidence level: 75%
2. Metastatic disease - Confidence level: 70%
3. Langerhans cell histiocytosis - Confidence level: 65%
4. Osteomyelitis with associated abscess - Confidence level: 60%
5. Giant cell tumor - Confidence level: 55%

The imaging characteristics suggest a lesion that is aggressive and involves both the bone and soft tissue, which could be consistent with a primary bone tumor such as chondrosarcoma, especially given the osseous defect and the location. Metastatic disease is also a consideration given the patient's age. The lack of adjacent parenchymal edema and the spontaneous resolution of symptoms over time are atypical for a malignant process, which may suggest a more indolent lesion. The significant interval decrease in lesion size and stability over a 2-year period without intervention also points away from a high-grade malignancy. Further clinical correlation, laboratory testing, and potentially biopsy would be required to reach a definitive diagnosis.",75,Insufficient
2023,Intramedullary Mature Teratoma,"Based on the initial presentation of a 19-year-old woman with right lower limb pain and weakness for 3 months accompanied by backache, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09282023, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Herniated intervertebral disc with nerve root compression
2. Spinal cord tumor, such as an ependymoma or astrocytoma
3. Spinal epidural abscess or hematoma
4. Inflammatory or demyelinating disease, such as transverse myelitis or multiple sclerosis
5. Vertebral osteomyelitis with associated spinal cord compression

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09282023/tab-legends, which describe an expansile intramedullary mass with craniocaudal expanse from D12_L2 level, heterogeneous hyperintensity on T2WI with hypointensity at the apex, hyperintensity on T1WI, and a crescentric streak of hyperdensity within the mass on CT, as well as hypodensity simulating fatty content, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Intramedullary lipoma - The presence of fat within the mass is highly suggestive of this diagnosis.
2. Lipomyelomeningocele - Given the fatty content and expansile nature of the lesion, although typically associated with spinal dysraphism.
3. Teratoma - These can contain various tissue elements, including fat, and can present as an intramedullary mass.
4. Dermoid cyst - Similar to teratomas, dermoid cysts can contain fat and present as a mass lesion.
5. Spinal cord ependymoma - While they can be heterogeneous and expansile, the presence of fat is less typical for ependymomas.

Confidence level: 90%

The confidence level is high because the imaging characteristics, particularly the presence of fat within the intramedullary mass, strongly suggest a diagnosis of an intramedullary lipoma or a related lesion containing fat. However, the possibility of other fat-containing lesions such as teratoma or dermoid cyst cannot be entirely excluded without histopathological confirmation.",90,Good
2023,Isoniazid Toxicity,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05112023, a 42-year-old man with chronic kidney disease and cervical tubercular lymphadenopathy presents with ataxia and slurring of speech after 2 months of antitubercular therapy. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for his neurological symptoms:

1. Drug-induced neurotoxicity (e.g., from isoniazid or ethambutol)
2. Tuberculous meningitis or CNS tuberculosis
3. Metabolic encephalopathy secondary to chronic kidney disease
4. Wernicke's encephalopathy
5. Cerebrovascular accident (stroke)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05112023/tab-legends, which describe fluffy, symmetrical hyperintensities within bilateral dentate nuclei on T2 and FLAIR MR images, no foci of blooming on gradient images, and hyperintensity on DWI without obvious restriction on the ADC map, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Metronidazole toxicity - Can cause symmetrical T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in the dentate nuclei, but the patient's medication history does not mention metronidazole.
2. Wernicke's encephalopathy - Typically associated with thiamine deficiency and can present with similar imaging findings, but other typical areas may also be involved.
3. Drug-induced neurotoxicity - Isoniazid or ethambutol toxicity could lead to similar findings, considering the patient's antitubercular therapy.
4. Hypoxic-ischemic injury - Can cause symmetrical damage, though the distribution is less typical for this pattern.
5. Bilirubin encephalopathy - Unlikely given the patient's age and lack of other clinical signs, but can present with hyperintensity in the basal ganglia and other nuclei.

Confidence level: 70%

The confidence level is set at 70% because the imaging findings suggest a toxic-metabolic etiology, which could be related to the patient's antitubercular therapy or his chronic kidney disease. However, without specific information on the patient's full medication regimen, vitamin levels, and other metabolic factors, there remains some uncertainty in the diagnosis. The symmetrical nature of the findings and the specific involvement of the dentate nuclei are key diagnostic clues.",70,Excellent
2023,Lipoid Proteinosis: Bilateral Amygdalae Calcifications,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10192023, a 35-year-old woman presents with recent onset aggressive behavior and increased sexual thoughts. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Frontotemporal dementia
2. Temporal lobe epilepsy
3. Hyperthyroidism
4. Bipolar disorder
5. Substance abuse or intoxication

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10192023/tab-legends, which describe comma-shaped symmetric calcification in bilateral amygdalae, focal hypointense signal in bilateral amygdalae on T2-weighted MRI, susceptibility changes in bilateral amygdalae on susceptibility-weighted MRI, and diffuse skin thickening over the elbow with variable-sized hyperpigmented plaques and papules, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Fahr's disease (Primary familial brain calcification) - Characterized by bilateral calcifications in the basal ganglia and other brain regions, which can be associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms.
2. Neurodegenerative disorder with brain calcifications - Such as certain forms of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA), although the amygdala is not a typical location.
3. Endocrine disorders - Such as hypoparathyroidism or pseudohypoparathyroidism, which can lead to brain calcifications and neuropsychiatric symptoms.
4. Infectious or post-infectious causes - Such as TORCH infections or CNS infections that can result in calcifications, but these are typically accompanied by other clinical signs.
5. Dermatological conditions with neurological manifestations - The skin findings may suggest a systemic condition that also affects the CNS, such as neurofibromatosis or tuberous sclerosis, although these typically have different patterns of calcification.

Confidence level: 85%

The confidence level is set at 85% because the presence of bilateral amygdala calcifications and associated neuropsychiatric symptoms strongly suggests a metabolic or genetic disorder leading to brain calcifications, such as Fahr's disease. The skin findings could be related or coincidental, but they raise the possibility of a systemic condition affecting multiple organ systems. Further clinical correlation, laboratory testing, and possibly genetic testing would be required to confirm the diagnosis.",85,Insufficient
2023,Marchiafava-Bignami Disease,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07272023, a 56-year-old man presents with cognitive complaints and aggressive behavior, with a history of heavy alcohol and tobacco use. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Alcohol-related dementia
2. Vascular dementia
3. Frontotemporal dementia
4. Alzheimer's disease
5. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy

Confidence Level: 65%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07272023/tab-legends, which describes thinning of the corpus callosum with symmetric T2 and T2/FLAIR hyperintensities involving the splenium with a cavitary formation and predominantly parietal atrophy, the differential diagnoses would be revised to consider:

1. Marchiafava-Bignami disease
2. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome
3. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder
4. Multiple sclerosis
5. Gliosis secondary to chronic ischemia or trauma

The imaging findings of callosal thinning and cavitary lesions, along with the patient's history of heavy alcohol use, suggest a diagnosis of Marchiafava-Bignami disease, which is a rare condition associated with chronic alcoholism and characterized by demyelination and necrosis of the corpus callosum. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is another alcohol-related condition that could present with similar symptoms but typically shows different imaging findings.

Confidence Level: 85%

Please note that these differential diagnoses are based on the provided data and that actual clinical decision-making would require a thorough clinical evaluation and additional diagnostic testing.",85,Excellent
2023,Meningeal Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumor,"Based on the initial presentation of a 17-year-old girl with worsening paroxysmal frontal headaches, nausea, and vomiting of 2 months' duration, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01262023, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Migraine with aura
2. Intracranial neoplasm
3. Intracranial cyst (e.g., arachnoid cyst)
4. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)
5. Sinus venous thrombosis

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01262023/tab-legends, which describe a large bilobed left frontal mass with areas of marked hypointensity and hyperintensity, mass effect upon the left frontal lobe, a discernible cortex from the mass with a thin CSF cleft confirming extra-axial location, no increased cerebral blood flow on ASL, no significant diffusion restriction on DWI, and histopathology showing proliferation of myofibroblastic/spindle cells and inflammatory infiltrate without necrosis, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Meningioma - Common extra-axial tumors that can present with a mass effect and variable enhancement, but the histopathology would typically show different features.
2. Solitary fibrous tumor/hemangiopericytoma - These can present as spindle cell tumors with variable enhancement and may not show significant diffusion restriction.
3. Inflammatory pseudotumor - A possibility given the inflammatory infiltrate and myofibroblastic proliferation without necrosis.
4. Sarcoma - A rare possibility but could present with similar histopathological findings.
5. Schwannoma - Typically arises from cranial nerves and can present as extra-axial masses, but the histopathology would be different.

Confidence level: 80%

The confidence level is set at 80% because the imaging and histopathological findings suggest a spindle cell lesion with an inflammatory component, which is consistent with a solitary fibrous tumor/hemangiopericytoma or an inflammatory pseudotumor. The lack of necrosis and the extra-axial location with a clear demarcation from the cortex also support these diagnoses. However, without a definitive histopathological diagnosis, there remains some uncertainty.",80,Good
2023,Middle Interhemispheric Variant of Holoprosencephaly,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05182023, a 7-year-old boy presents with a history of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Fragile X syndrome
2. Rett syndrome
3. Tuberous sclerosis complex
4. Down syndrome
5. Cerebral palsy

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05182023/tab-legends, which describe abnormal nonseparation of the posterior frontal lobes with preserved separation of the anterior frontal and occipital lobes, an extremely thinned/absent body of the corpus callosum with relative preservation of the rostrum, genu, and splenium, absence of the septum pellucidum, hypoplastic frontal horns of the lateral ventricles, partial midline fusion of the thalami seen as prominent massa intermedia, and areas of cortical thickening along the bridging brain parenchyma and along the posterior aspects of both Sylvian fissures due to polymicrogyria, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Holoprosencephaly - The nonseparation of the posterior frontal lobes and partial fusion of the thalami suggest this condition.
2. Septo-optic dysplasia - The absence of the septum pellucidum and corpus callosum abnormalities are consistent with this diagnosis.
3. Lobar schizencephaly - The presence of polymicrogyria and ventricular abnormalities may be related to this condition.
4. Agenesis of the corpus callosum - The thinning/absence of the body of the corpus callosum is a hallmark of this condition, although other findings may not fit as well.
5. Pachygyria - The cortical thickening could be due to pachygyria, but it is typically more diffuse than polymicrogyria.

Confidence level: 90%

The confidence level is high because the imaging findings are characteristic of a midline malformation of brain development, with features that strongly suggest holoprosencephaly or septo-optic dysplasia. The presence of polymicrogyria and the specific pattern of corpus callosum thinning/absence further support these diagnoses. However, the exact diagnosis would depend on the full clinical picture and potentially genetic testing.",90,Excellent
2023,Neurosarcoidosis,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08172023, a 46-year-old woman from Angola presents with a headache, left face numbness, followed by left facial palsy, elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level, and fluorescein angiography compatible with intermediate uveitis. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Sarcoidosis
2. Tuberculosis
3. Lymphoma
4. Wegener's granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis)
5. Metastatic disease

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08172023/tab-legends, which describe bilaterally enlarged Meckel caves, isointense to cortical gray matter, enhancement of the trigeminal ganglion of the left facial nerve (meatal and labyrinthine segments, geniculate ganglion), and mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Sarcoidosis - The combination of elevated ACE levels, uveitis, cranial nerve enhancement, and lymphadenopathy is highly suggestive of sarcoidosis.
2. Tuberculosis - Given the patient's geographic location and the presence of lymphadenopathy, tuberculosis is a consideration, although it may not explain the uveitis.
3. Neurosarcoidosis - A specific form of sarcoidosis involving the nervous system, which can cause cranial neuropathies and Meckel cave enlargement.
4. Lymphoma - Can present with cranial nerve involvement and lymphadenopathy, but systemic symptoms and other imaging findings would be expected.
5. Infectious processes - Such as fungal infections or other granulomatous diseases, which can cause similar imaging findings and are endemic in certain regions.

Confidence level: 95%

The confidence level is high because the clinical presentation, elevated ACE level, and imaging findings are characteristic of sarcoidosis, particularly neurosarcoidosis. The presence of intermediate uveitis, cranial nerve involvement, and lymphadenopathy align well with this diagnosis. However, a definitive diagnosis would require further clinical correlation, possibly including tissue biopsy and additional laboratory tests.",95,Excellent
2023,Neurosyphilis - Otosyphilis,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04062023, a young female patient presents with bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus for several weeks, initially seen with rash and sore throat at symptom onset. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED)
2. Meningitis (viral or bacterial)
3. Ramsay Hunt syndrome
4. Vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma)
5. Lyme disease

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04062023/tab-legends, which describe no mass lesion on FIESTA axial MRI of the internal auditory canal (IAC), enhancement of the IACs and cochlea bilaterally on T1-weighted pre- and postcontrast MRI, and subtle trigeminal nerve enhancement, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Neurosarcoidosis - Can cause bilateral hearing loss, tinnitus, and cranial nerve enhancement.
2. Lyme disease - Known to cause cranial neuropathies, including bilateral facial nerve palsy, and could explain the initial rash and sore throat.
3. Viral meningitis or encephalitis - Can lead to cranial nerve enhancement and auditory symptoms, especially with a preceding sore throat and rash.
4. Cogan's syndrome - An autoimmune disease that can cause interstitial keratitis, audiovestibular symptoms, and potentially cranial nerve enhancement.
5. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's granulomatosis) - A vasculitis that can affect the ears, nose, throat, and other organs, leading to nerve enhancement.

Confidence level: 80%

The confidence level is set at 80% because the imaging findings of bilateral IAC and cochlear enhancement, along with the clinical presentation, suggest an inflammatory or autoimmune process. The absence of a mass lesion makes neoplastic causes less likely. However, without further clinical correlation and laboratory testing, there remains some uncertainty in the diagnosis. The presence of trigeminal nerve enhancement adds complexity to the case and may indicate a more systemic process.",80,Insufficient
2023,Pituitary Apoplexy with Subarachnoid Hemorrhage and Todd Paralysis,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12072023, a 36-year-old woman with a history of pituitary macroadenoma treated with trans-sphenoidal decompression and radiation therapy presents with seizure, right hemiparesis, and postictal confusion. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Radiation necrosis
2. Recurrent/residual pituitary macroadenoma
3. Pituitary apoplexy
4. Secondary brain tumor (radiation-induced neoplasm)
5. Ischemic stroke

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12072023/tab-legends, which describe a T2 isointense to hypointense lobulated lesion in the sella with left parasellar extension, hyperintensity in the left parieto-temporo-occipital cortex, diffusion restriction in the left temporo-occipital cortex, mild hyperintensity on T1, blooming on T2* gradient-echo image, and heterogeneous enhancement post-contrast without parenchymal enhancement, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Radiation necrosis - The imaging findings of a lesion with blooming on gradient-echo and heterogeneous enhancement could be consistent with radiation necrosis, especially given the patient's history of radiation therapy.
2. Recurrent/residual pituitary macroadenoma - The location and heterogeneous enhancement could suggest tumor recurrence or residual growth.
3. Cerebral metastasis - Although less likely without known primary malignancy, the imaging characteristics could fit with metastatic disease.
4. Infectious or inflammatory process - Such as abscess or granulomatous disease, which can present with ring-enhancing lesions and diffusion restriction.
5. Hemorrhagic stroke - The blooming effect on gradient-echo imaging could indicate hemorrhage, which might be related to previous surgery or radiation therapy.

Confidence level: 85%

The confidence level is set at 85% because the imaging findings and clinical history suggest a complication related to the patient's previous treatments, such as radiation necrosis or recurrent tumor. The presence of diffusion restriction and the lesion's imaging characteristics after contrast administration are particularly suggestive of these conditions. However, without histopathological confirmation, there remains some uncertainty, and other differential diagnoses cannot be completely excluded.",85,Excellent
2023,Polymorphous Low-grade Neuroepithelial Tumor of the Young,"Based on the initial presentation of an 8-year-old girl with a history of epilepsy, new-onset right arm numbness, head tilt, and difficulty speaking, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Low-grade glioma or ganglioglioma
2. Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET)
3. Focal cortical dysplasia
4. Arteriovenous malformation (AVM)
5. Cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08242023/tab-legends, which describe a tiny calcification and cystic lesion in the left postcentral gyrus on CT, a well-defined cyst with punctate T1 hyperintensity and no contrast enhancement on MRI, low signal intensity cyst with surrounding high signal intensity in the cortex and subcortical white matter on FLAIR, and a well-defined cyst with a punctate hyperintensity relating to the calcification seen on CT without contrast enhancement, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Neurocysticercosis - The presence of a cystic lesion with a scolex (calcification) is characteristic of this parasitic infection.
2. Cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) - Can present with a well-defined lesion and associated calcification, but typically would have a more ""popcorn-like"" appearance on MRI.
3. Arachnoid cyst - Can appear as a well-defined cystic lesion, but the presence of calcification is not typical.
4. Oligodendroglioma - May present with calcification and cystic components, but usually would show some contrast enhancement.
5. Ganglioglioma - A tumor that can present with cystic and solid components, often with calcifications, but usually enhances with contrast.

Confidence level: 90%

The confidence level is high because the imaging characteristics, particularly the presence of a cystic lesion with a scolex (calcification), are highly suggestive of neurocysticercosis. This diagnosis is consistent with the patient's clinical presentation and the imaging findings. However, the definitive diagnosis would require serological testing and possibly further imaging to confirm the presence of additional lesions.",90,Insufficient
2023,Polymorphous Low-Grade Neuroepithelial Tumor of the Young (PLNTY),"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01192023, a 10-year-old boy with no past medical history presents with seizure-like activity for the past 2 months. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Focal cortical dysplasia
2. Low-grade glioma or ganglioglioma
3. Arteriovenous malformation (AVM)
4. Cerebral abscess
5. Temporal lobe epilepsy due to hippocampal sclerosis

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01192023/tab-legends, which describe a well-circumscribed, heterogeneous mass within the medial left temporal lobe centered mainly within the amygdala, with mild central and thin peripheral enhancement, heterogeneity with some hyperintense cystic areas, no evidence of restricted diffusion, susceptibility effect centrally within the mass, and no increased cerebral blood flow within the mass, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Ganglioglioma - A common cause of seizures in children, which can present as a well-circumscribed mass with cystic components and variable enhancement.
2. Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) - A rare brain tumor that often presents with seizures and can have a cystic appearance with enhancement.
3. Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET) - Typically presents in children and young adults with seizures and can have a cystic, non-enhancing appearance.
4. Low-grade glioma - Such as pilocytic astrocytoma, which can present with a well-circumscribed mass and cystic areas.
5. Neurocysticercosis - A parasitic infection that can present with seizures and cystic brain lesions, though the enhancement pattern is less typical.

Confidence level: 85%

The confidence level is set at 85% because the imaging characteristics of a well-circumscribed mass with cystic components and mild enhancement are suggestive of a low-grade neuroepithelial tumor, which is common in this age group and presentation. The lack of restricted diffusion and increased blood flow also supports a benign etiology. However, the exact histological diagnosis would require further investigation, including potentially a biopsy.",85,Good
2023,Posterior Epidural Cyst Associated with Baastrup Disease,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11232023, a 54-year-old nondiabetic, nonhypertensive man presents with lower back pain for 3 months. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Lumbar disc herniation
2. Lumbar spinal stenosis
3. Degenerative disc disease
4. Spondylolisthesis
5. Musculoskeletal strain

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11232023/tab-legends, which describe a well-circumscribed T1-hypointense midline extradural lesion posterior to the spinal cord at the level of L5 vertebra with a T1-hypointense track between the L4 and L5 spinous process, T2 hyperintensity suggesting fluid nature, and intense homogeneous contrast enhancement of the posterior epidural cystic structure with a connecting linear enhancing track to the interspinous bursa, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Synovial cyst - The location and fluid signal characteristics could indicate a synovial cyst, which can cause back pain and radiculopathy.
2. Extradural arachnoid cyst - These can present as well-circumscribed fluid-filled lesions with similar imaging characteristics.
3. Epidural abscess - The enhancement pattern could suggest an infectious process, although the clinical presentation may not be typical.
4. Hematoma - Could present with similar imaging findings, especially if there is a history of trauma or anticoagulation.
5. Meningocele - A type of spinal dysraphism that can present as a cystic lesion, but typically would be more anteriorly located.

Confidence level: 90%

The confidence level is high because the imaging findings of a well-circumscribed extradural cystic lesion with a fluid signal and enhancement pattern are suggestive of a synovial cyst or extradural arachnoid cyst. The connection to the interspinous bursa further supports the diagnosis of a synovial cyst. However, without clinical correlation and potentially further diagnostic tests such as laboratory analysis of aspirated cyst fluid, there remains a small degree of uncertainty.",90,Good
2023,Posterior Quadrantic Dysplasia,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03162023, a 4-year-old boy presents for evaluation of intractable epilepsy. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Focal cortical dysplasia
2. Tuberous sclerosis complex
3. Hemimegalencephaly
4. Sturge-Weber syndrome (without facial port-wine stain)
5. Cortical tumor (such as dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor or ganglioglioma)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03162023/tab-legends, which describe asymmetric enlargement of the left temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes with bulging of the posterior falx cerebri to the right, uniform diffuse cortical thickening, decreased gray-white matter differentiation, increased white matter volume, abnormally deep sulcation in the left parietal region, and asymmetric enlargement and dysmorphic appearance of the trigone and occipital horn of the left lateral ventricle, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Hemimegalencephaly - The asymmetric enlargement of one cerebral hemisphere and associated findings are characteristic of this condition.
2. Focal cortical dysplasia - Especially the more extensive forms that can involve a large portion of a hemisphere.
3. Cortical malformation due to in utero ischemic insult - Which can lead to atrophy or dysplasia of a cerebral hemisphere.
4. Rasmussen encephalitis - A chronic inflammatory disease that can cause unilateral hemispheric atrophy and epilepsy, although it typically progresses over time.
5. Low-grade glioma or ganglioglioma - These tumors can cause epilepsy and may involve large areas of the brain, but they usually have more focal features.

Confidence level: 95%

The confidence level is high because the imaging findings strongly suggest a diagnosis of hemimegalencephaly, given the extensive involvement of one cerebral hemisphere with associated cortical and white matter abnormalities. This condition is a well-known cause of intractable epilepsy in children. However, the definitive diagnosis would require clinical correlation and possibly genetic testing to rule out associated syndromes.",95,Good
2023,Primary CNS T Cell Lymphoma (Lymphomatosis Cerebri Pattern),"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08032023, a 34-year-old man presents with a 2-day history of repetitive right-sided jerky movements and right-sided weakness, along with altered sensorium. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Ischemic stroke
2. Seizure with postictal paralysis (Todd's paralysis)
3. Multiple sclerosis
4. Brain tumor with associated edema or seizure
5. Encephalitis

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08032023/tab-legends, which describe multiple bilateral hyperintensities involving the frontal and parietal lobes, cingulate gyrus, and bilateral insular cortices on FLAIR images, diffusion restriction in bilateral parieto-temporal areas on DWI, hyperintense signals involving the corpus callosum on T2-weighted images, subtle hyperintense signals in the corpus callosum on FLAIR, and a biopsy slide showing lymphoid cells predominantly positive for CD3 and CD4 immunohistochemical stains, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Lymphoma - The presence of lymphoid cells positive for CD3 and CD4 suggests a lymphoproliferative disorder such as CNS lymphoma.
2. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) - Characterized by multifocal lesions in the white matter and may present with similar imaging findings.
3. Viral encephalitis - Can cause diffuse brain involvement and altered mental status, with possible lymphocytic infiltration.
4. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) - A demyelinating disease caused by the JC virus in immunocompromised individuals, which can present with multifocal white matter lesions.
5. Vasculitis - An inflammatory condition affecting the blood vessels in the brain, which can lead to multifocal lesions and neurological deficits.

Confidence level: 90%

The confidence level is high because the imaging findings of multifocal white matter lesions, the clinical presentation, and the biopsy results showing lymphoid cells are suggestive of a lymphoproliferative disorder such as CNS lymphoma. The involvement of the corpus callosum and the presence of diffusion restriction support a diagnosis of a high-grade process. However, the definitive diagnosis would require correlation with additional clinical data, laboratory findings, and potentially further imaging studies.",90,Excellent
2023,Primary Extradural Meningioma,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07132023, a 20-year-old woman presents with an enlarging lump overlying the left temporal bone. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for this presentation:

1. Osteoma
2. Epidermoid cyst
3. Dermoid cyst
4. Fibrous dysplasia
5. Hemangioma

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07132023/tab-legends, which describe a left squamous temporal bone lucent expansile lesion with associated thinning of the cortex and areas of cortical disruption, interconnected multilobulated cystic dilations along the superior margin of the lesion, high signal lesion on T2WI centered in the deeper layer of the calvarium, almost complete suppression of the lesion on FLAIR, minimal punctate areas of enhancement on T1-weighted postcontrast image, and mild uptake on bone SPECT scan along the superior aspect of the lesion, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Epidermoid cyst - The lucent expansile lesion with minimal enhancement and high T2 signal could be consistent with an epidermoid cyst.
2. Dermoid cyst - Similar to epidermoid cysts but may contain fat, which can show different signal characteristics on MRI.
3. Fibrous dysplasia - Can present as a lucent expansile lesion with cortical thinning, but the multilobulated cystic dilations are less typical.
4. Aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) - The multilobulated cystic appearance and expansile nature of the lesion could suggest an ABC.
5. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) - Can present with lytic skull lesions and mild enhancement, although the cystic nature is less common.

Confidence level: 85%

The confidence level is set at 85% because the imaging characteristics of a lucent expansile lesion with cystic components and minimal enhancement are suggestive of a benign cystic lesion such as an epidermoid or dermoid cyst. The lack of significant enhancement and the signal characteristics on T2WI and FLAIR support this diagnosis. However, the presence of multilobulated cystic dilations raises the possibility of other entities like an aneurysmal bone cyst, and further investigation, such as biopsy, may be required for a definitive diagnosis.",85,Good

1. Meningitis
2. Encephalitis
3. Intracranial abscess
4. Cerebral vasculitis
5. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09072023/tab-legends, which describe imaging characteristics such as diffuse hypoattenuation in the left cerebellar hemisphere, ill-defined expansion with increased signal in the cortex and white matter of the left cerebellum, mass effect on the brainstem and fourth ventricle, obstructive hydrocephalus, restricted diffusion, microhemorrhages, and minor enhancement along the cerebellar folia, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Cerebellitis - Confidence level: 80%
2. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) - Confidence level: 70%
3. Cerebral infarction with hemorrhagic transformation - Confidence level: 60%
4. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis - Confidence level: 50%

1. Recurrent medulloblastoma with dural metastasis - Confidence level: 95%
2. Osteosarcoma or other radiation-induced sarcoma - Confidence level: 80%
3. Metastatic disease from another primary tumor - Confidence level: 70%
4. Inflammatory pseudotumor - Confidence level: 50%
5. Infectious process such as osteomyelitis with abscess formation - Confidence level: 40%

The confidence levels are adjusted based on the imaging characteristics, which suggest a malignant process, and the patient's known history of medulloblastoma, making recurrence the most likely diagnosis. However, the possibility of a radiation-induced secondary malignancy or another metastatic disease should also be considered.

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11302023/tab-legends, which describe axial CTA MIP images showing a multitude of small vessels in a plexiform configuration in the left M1 segment, decreased early contrast filling in the left MCA territory with normal right MCA territory vessels, and angiography images demonstrating plexiform M1, delayed arterial filling in the left MCA territory, and normal vessel appearance otherwise, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Moyamoya disease - Confidence level: 90%
2. Cocaine-induced vasospasm leading to ischemic changes - Confidence level: 85%
3. Vasculitis (non-cocaine induced) - Confidence level: 70%
4. Intracranial arterial dissection - Confidence level: 65%
5. Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) - Confidence level: 75%

The confidence levels are adjusted based on the imaging characteristics, which suggest a vascular abnormality with plexiform vessels and delayed arterial filling, and the patient's history of cocaine use, which is known to cause vasospasm and vasculitis. Moyamoya disease is a strong consideration given the imaging findings, but the patient's history of substance use must also be factored into the differential.

1. Meningitis (bacterial, fungal, or tuberculous) - Confidence level: 85%
2. Carcinomatous meningitis (metastatic disease to the meninges) - Confidence level: 80%
3. Rheumatoid meningitis (given the history of rheumatoid arthritis) - Confidence level: 75%
4. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) with secondary inflammatory response - Confidence level: 70%
5. CNS vasculitis (primary or secondary to rheumatoid arthritis) - Confidence level: 75%

The confidence levels are adjusted based on the imaging characteristics, which suggest a meningeal process, and the patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis, which could be associated with rheumatoid meningitis or secondary CNS vasculitis. The presence of leptomeningeal and pachymeningeal enhancement is particularly suggestive of an inflammatory or neoplastic process affecting the meninges. Further clinical correlation, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and potentially additional imaging or laboratory tests would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",85,Excellent
2023,Rosai-Dorfman Disease,"Based on the summary of the content from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02092023), a 64-year-old man presents with a history of progressive painless swelling of the face and nasal blockade for 1 year duration. Without specific imaging findings, here are five general differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Chronic sinusitis with or without polyposis
2. Benign neoplasms such as inverted papilloma or juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma
3. Malignant neoplasms such as squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the sinuses
4. Sarcoidosis
5. Wegener's granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis)

Confidence Level: 40% - This confidence level is due to the broad nature of the differential diagnoses without specific imaging findings.

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02092023/tab-legends), which describes homogeneous enhancing T2-iso/hypointense soft tissue in both nasal cavities, paranasal sinuses, and various other locations with scalloping and erosion of the maxillary sinuses and nasal septum, and widening of bilateral infraorbital foramen, the differential diagnoses can be revised to reflect conditions that might present with these specific imaging characteristics:

1. Extranodal Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
2. Sarcoma (e.g., rhabdomyosarcoma, especially given the extensive involvement)
3. Invasive fungal sinusitis (e.g., mucormycosis, especially in immunocompromised patients)
4. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's granulomatosis)
5. IgG4-related disease

Confidence Level: 70% - This confidence level is higher because the differential diagnoses are now based on specific imaging findings that are characteristic of certain pathologies.

1. Encephalitis (including herpes simplex virus) - Confidence level: 90%
2. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) - Confidence level: 85%
3. Cerebral vasculitis - Confidence level: 75%
4. Infectious or septic emboli with multifocal infarcts - Confidence level: 70%
5. Malignant brain neoplasm with leptomeningeal dissemination - Confidence level: 65%

The confidence levels are adjusted based on the imaging characteristics, which suggest an inflammatory or infectious process, particularly given the presence of fever and acute neurological symptoms. The imaging findings of cortical and subcortical hyperintensities with diffusion restriction and sulcal enhancement are more suggestive of an infectious or inflammatory process rather than a neoplastic one. Encephalitis, particularly herpes simplex virus encephalitis, is a strong consideration given the involvement of the frontal lobes and hippocampi. ADEM is also a consideration given the acute presentation and multifocal brain lesions. Further clinical correlation, laboratory tests, and potentially lumbar puncture would be necessary to refine the diagnosis.",90,Insufficient

3. Metastatic carcinoma - Confidence level: 80%
4. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma with skull base invasion - Confidence level: 75%
5. Lymphoma - Confidence level: 70%

The confidence levels are adjusted based on the imaging characteristics, which suggest a primary bone lesion with aggressive features and the potential for a neoplastic process. Chordoma is a strong consideration given the location in the clivus and the presence of calcifications. Chondrosarcoma is also a possibility due to its potential to arise in the skull base and show similar imaging features. Metastatic disease is less likely but should be considered given the patient's age and the extensive nature of the lesion.

1. Subcutaneous lipoma with underlying osseous hyperostosis
2. Osteoma cutis
3. Fibrous dysplasia with associated soft tissue mass
4. Epidermal inclusion cyst with reactive bone changes
5. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) with bone involvement

The imaging characteristics of a T1- and T2-hyperintense lesion that suppresses on fat-saturated images suggest a fat-containing lesion, which is consistent with a diagnosis of lipoma. The presence of hyperostosis in the right parietal bone could represent a benign osseous lesion or reactive change.

After reviewing the additional imaging findings provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06222023/tab-legends, which describes a large intradural extramedullary solid and cystic mass with avid enhancement of the solid component, complete filling of the spinal canal by the lesion, remodeling of the posterior vertebral margins and posterior elements, and extensive vascular flow voids within the lesion extending cranially along the thoracic and cervical cord, the differential diagnoses would be revised to consider:

1. Schwannoma or neurofibroma
2. Meningioma
3. Hemangioblastoma
4. Spinal arteriovenous malformation with associated mass effect
5. Metastatic disease with secondary vascular changes

The presence of a large intradural extramedullary mass with solid and cystic components and extensive vascular flow voids suggests a tumor with a significant vascular component, such as a hemangioblastoma or a highly vascularized meningioma. The remodeling of the vertebral elements also suggests a slow-growing process.

1. Lipoma or liposarcoma with calcification
2. Dermoid or epidermoid cyst with calcification
3. Calcified lymph node secondary to chronic inflammation or infection
4. Benign salivary gland tumor (e.g., pleomorphic adenoma) with fatty changes and calcification
5. Sialolithiasis with associated soft tissue changes

The presence of a lesion with fat density and calcifications below the level of the geniohyoid muscle suggests a benign etiology, such as a lipoma or a dermoid cyst, rather than a malignant process. However, the possibility of a low-grade liposarcoma should also be considered given the patient's smoking history and the presence of an ulceroproliferative growth.

1. Acute ischemic stroke - Confidence level: 85%
2. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) - Confidence level: 70%
3. Hemorrhagic stroke - Confidence level: 65%
4. Inflammatory or infectious central nervous system (CNS) condition (e.g., encephalitis, meningitis) - Confidence level: 60%
5. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) - Confidence level: 55%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07202023/tab-legends, which describe focal restricted diffusion in the right putamen suggestive of an acute infarct, focal irregularity and narrowing in the right MCA M1 segment on TOF-MRA angiogram, leptomeningeal enhancement in the basal cisterns, multiple ring-enhancing lesions, extensive long segment T2 hyperintense signal in the spinal cord parenchyma, signal abnormality in the center of the upper cervical cord, and extensive enhancement along the surface of the cord and in the thecal sac with multiple miliary nodules in the cord parenchyma, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. CNS vasculitis - Confidence level: 80%
2. Infectious meningitis with secondary vasculitis or infarction (e.g., tuberculosis, bacterial, fungal) - Confidence level: 85%
3. Metastatic disease (less likely in this age group) - Confidence level: 50%
4. Neurosarcoidosis - Confidence level: 75%
5. Parainfectious or postinfectious process (e.g., ADEM) - Confidence level: 70%

The combination of cerebral infarct, vascular irregularities, leptomeningeal enhancement, and spinal cord involvement with miliary nodules suggests a widespread inflammatory or infectious process. Infectious meningitis with secondary vasculitis or infarction, particularly tuberculosis given the miliary nodules, is a strong consideration. CNS vasculitis could also present with these findings but would be less common in this age group. Neurosarcoidosis and parainfectious processes are also possible but less likely given the imaging findings and the acute presentation. Further clinical correlation, CSF analysis, and potentially biopsy would be required to reach a definitive diagnosis.",80,Excellent
2023,Tumefactive Demyelinating Lesions,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12142023, a 50-year-old woman presents with numbness of the right limb and face accompanied by unsteady walking for 10 days. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Ischemic stroke - Confidence level: 80%
2. Multiple sclerosis (MS) - Confidence level: 70%
3. Brainstem glioma - Confidence level: 65%
4. Inflammatory demyelinating disease (e.g., neuromyelitis optica) - Confidence level: 60%
5. Infectious or granulomatous disease (e.g., tuberculosis, neurosarcoidosis) - Confidence level: 55%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12142023/tab-legends, which describe a left paramedian lesion in the medulla oblongata with T1 hypointensity, T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity, hypointense signal within the central part and hyperintensity around the edges on DWI, incomplete rim enhancement after gadolinium administration, and 1H-MR spectroscopy showing dramatically increased choline and mildly decreased N-acetylaspartate with elevated Cho/NAA and Cho/Cr ratios, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. High-grade glioma (e.g., glioblastoma) - Confidence level: 85%
2. Metastatic brain lesion - Confidence level: 75%
3. Abscess (bacterial or fungal) - Confidence level: 70%
4. Demyelinating lesion (e.g., tumefactive MS) - Confidence level: 65%
5. Lymphoma - Confidence level: 60%

The imaging characteristics, particularly the spectroscopy findings of increased choline and decreased N-acetylaspartate, suggest a high turnover of cell membranes, which is often seen in high-grade gliomas or metastatic lesions. The incomplete rim enhancement could be seen in both neoplastic and infectious processes, such as an abscess. Demyelinating lesions and lymphoma are also considerations given the location and imaging features, but the elevated Cho/NAA and Cho/Cr ratios make a neoplastic process more likely. Further evaluation, including biopsy, may be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis.",85,Insufficient
2023,Uremic Leontiasis Ossea,"Based on the summary of the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09212023), we have a case involving a 55-year-old man with end-stage renal disease. However, without specific imaging findings or clinical details, it is challenging to provide differential diagnoses. Nonetheless, I can suggest some common conditions associated with end-stage renal disease that may have neuroradiological manifestations:

1. Cerebrovascular disease (e.g., ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke)
2. Hypertensive encephalopathy
3. Uremic encephalopathy
4. Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome
5. Metabolic or toxic encephalopathy

Confidence Level: 50% - This confidence level reflects the broad nature of the differential without specific imaging findings or clinical details.

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09212023/tab-legends), which describes CT images showing diffuse hypertrophy with extensive serpentine channels throughout the entire mandible, resorptive trabecular changes with a ""salt-and-pepper"" appearance in the skull base and calvarium, and an expanded and ground-glass appearance of the mandibular rami, the differential diagnoses can be revised to reflect conditions that might present with these specific bone changes:

1. Fibrous dysplasia
2. Paget's disease of bone
3. Hyperparathyroidism (secondary to chronic renal failure)
4. Osteitis deformans
5. Osteopetrosis

Confidence Level: 80% - This confidence level is higher because the differential diagnoses are now based on specific imaging findings that are characteristic of certain bone pathologies. However, without the ability to review the images directly and without additional clinical information, the confidence level cannot be 100%.",80,Excellent
2023,WHO Grade 1 Cystic Meningioma (Type I/II),"The webpage from the American Journal of Neuroradiology describes a case dated April 27, 2023, involving an 8-cm solid and cystic mass in the paramedian mid and posterior right frontal lobe of the brain. The mass is noted to have a broad base along the interhemispheric falx and dura, with marked mass effect on the corpus callosum and frontal horns of the lateral ventricles. The mass shows avid, homogeneous enhancement in solid components and features T2 hyperintense signal in nonenhancing components, indicating a multicystic nature. There's no significant vasogenic edema, and the solid parts exhibit low ADC signal indicative of restricted diffusion.

For detailed information and to view the images, please visit the [AJNR website](https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04272023).

I will now provide five differential diagnoses for this case. After reviewing the diagram description, I will revise the differential diagnoses and include confidence levels.

Based on the case description from the American Journal of Neuroradiology dated April 27, 2023, the initial differential diagnoses for the described brain mass could include:

1. Meningioma (Confidence: 85%)
2. Hemangiopericytoma (Confidence: 70%)
3. Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) (Confidence: 60%)
4. Metastatic brain tumor (Confidence: 65%)
5. Primary CNS lymphoma (Confidence: 55%)

Now, let's revise these differentials after reviewing the diagram description for further insights. Please view the images and detailed case description on the AJNR website for a comprehensive understanding: [AJNR Case of the Week](https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04272023).

After reviewing the diagram description from the AJNR Case of the Week (April 27, 2023), the revised differential diagnoses with updated confidence levels are:

1. Meningioma (Confidence: 90%)
2. Hemangiopericytoma (Confidence: 75%)
3. Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) (Confidence: 65%)
4. Metastatic brain tumor (Confidence: 70%)

2022,A Rare Presentation of Klippel-Feil Syndrome: The Single Cervical Vertebra,"Based on the provided content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology, which I accessed through the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06232022, the case involves a 60-year-old woman with neck pain. The content does not provide specific details about the imaging findings or the clinical presentation that would allow for a comprehensive differential diagnosis. Therefore, I will list five general differential diagnoses for neck pain in a 60-year-old woman, which are common considerations in clinical practice:

1. Cervical spondylosis
2. Cervical disc herniation
3. Cervical stenosis with myelopathy
4. Osteoarthritis of the cervical spine
5. Cervical vertebral fracture

Confidence Level: 60%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06232022/tab-legends, which describes specific radiological findings such as complete fusion of the C2 through C7 vertebral bodies, atlantoaxial subluxation, basilar invagination, fusion of the right lateral masses of C2 to C7, and cervicomedullary compression, the differential diagnosis can be revised to reflect these findings:

1. Congenital fusion of cervical vertebrae (block vertebra)
2. Klippel-Feil syndrome
3. Basilar invagination secondary to atlantoaxial instability
4. Cervical myelopathy secondary to congenital anomalies
5. Rheumatoid arthritis with atlantoaxial subluxation

Confidence Level: 90%

The specific imaging findings such as the complete fusion of multiple cervical vertebrae and the presence of atlantoaxial subluxation are more suggestive of congenital or developmental conditions such as Klippel-Feil syndrome, or possibly acquired conditions that lead to instability and secondary basilar invagination, such as rheumatoid arthritis. The presence of cervicomedullary compression is a critical finding that may require surgical intervention to prevent further neurological compromise. It is important to correlate these findings with the patient's clinical symptoms and history for an accurate diagnosis.",90,Excellent
2022,ACTA2-related Cerebrovascular Disease,"Based on the initial clinical presentation of a 43-year-old man with left upper and lower extremity weakness and left-sided facial droop, as described in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06162022, here are five differential diagnoses:

1. Ischemic stroke
2. Hemorrhagic stroke
3. Brain tumor causing mass effect and neurological deficits
4. Multiple sclerosis (MS) with an acute exacerbation
5. Intracranial infection (e.g., abscess or encephalitis) leading to focal neurological signs

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06162022/tab-legends, which describes imaging findings such as a right frontal and insular infarct, a V-shaped anterior corpus callosum, dilated occipital horns of the lateral ventricles, a dilated proximal internal carotid artery with an abnormally straight course of the intracranial arteries, and a ""twin peaks"" pons, the differential diagnosis can be revised to reflect these specific findings:

1. Moyamoya disease, given the ""puff of smoke"" appearance with stenosis of the intracranial arteries and the development of collateral networks
2. Ischemic stroke due to other vasculopathies, considering the infarct and abnormal vascular imaging
3. Congenital or developmental anomaly, such as Aicardi syndrome, given the colpocephaly-like ventricular dilation and corpus callosum dysgenesis
4. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), which can present with multifocal lesions and may involve the corpus callosum
5. Neurosarcoidosis or other granulomatous diseases, which can cause a variety of CNS lesions and vascular abnormalities

Confidence Level: 85%

The imaging findings suggest a vascular etiology with a complex presentation, possibly indicative of a rare vasculopathy like Moyamoya disease, which is characterized by progressive stenosis of the internal carotid arteries and the development of collateral networks that can appear as abnormal ""puff of smoke"" vessels on angiography. The absence of basal collaterals and the presence of a ""twin peaks"" pons are also suggestive of this diagnosis. The V-shaped corpus callosum and other described anomalies may be secondary to chronic ischemia or represent a congenital anomaly. It is crucial to correlate these imaging findings with the patient's clinical history and presentation for an accurate diagnosis.",85,Insufficient
2022,Acute Hyperextension gSurferfsh Myelopathy,"Based on the clinical presentation of an 8-year-old girl with progressive leg weakness, hyperreflexia, and urinary retention after hyperextending her back during a handstand, and with normal CSF analysis, here are five differential diagnoses:

1. Transverse myelitis
2. Spinal cord injury due to trauma
3. Spinal cord tumor (e.g., astrocytoma, ependymoma)
4. Guillain-Barr_ syndrome (GBS)
5. Spinal cord arteriovenous malformation (AVM)

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01272022/tab-legends, which describes MRI spine findings of hyperintense T2 signal abnormality with mild cord expansion through the distal spinal cord that resolved on follow-up imaging approximately 6 weeks later, the differential diagnosis can be revised to reflect these findings:

1. Transient myelopathy
2. Idiopathic transverse myelitis
3. Spinal cord concussion
4. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)
5. Spinal cord infarction

Confidence Level: 85%

The resolution of the MRI findings on follow-up imaging suggests a transient or inflammatory process rather than a permanent structural abnormality. The absence of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) makes it difficult to rule out certain conditions like spinal cord infarction, but the complete resolution of findings is not typical for infarction. The clinical presentation and imaging findings are more suggestive of a transient myelopathy or idiopathic transverse myelitis, especially given the history of a preceding event (hyperextension during a handstand) and the absence of a compressive lesion or abnormal CSF findings. It is important to consider the temporal evolution of symptoms and imaging findings, as well as the patient's age and clinical history, when making a diagnosis.",85,Good
2022,Alexander Disease Type I,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 4-year-old girl with a gait disorder and cognitive developmental delay, as described in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02102022, here are five differential diagnoses:

1. Leukodystrophy (e.g., metachromatic leukodystrophy, Krabbe disease)
2. Mitochondrial disorder (e.g., Leigh syndrome)
3. Cerebral palsy with white matter injury
4. Inborn errors of metabolism (e.g., phenylketonuria)
5. Infectious or post-infectious encephalomyelitis

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02102022/tab-legends, which describes extensive and symmetric cerebral white matter abnormalities with a frontal predominance, changes in the basal ganglia, a hypointense periventricular rim on T2-weighted images that is hyperintense on T1-weighted images, involvement of the medulla, decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the abnormal white matter, increased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in the abnormal white matter, and spectroscopy findings of decreased N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and elevated choline (Cho), myoinositol, and lactate, the differential diagnosis can be revised to reflect these specific findings:

1. Leukodystrophy (specific types to consider include Canavan disease, Alexander disease)
2. Mitochondrial encephalopathy (e.g., Leigh syndrome, given the basal ganglia involvement)
3. Organic acidemias (e.g., glutaric aciduria type I, given the frontotemporal atrophy)
4. Lysosomal storage diseases (e.g., metachromatic leukodystrophy, given the white matter changes)
5. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, considering the pattern of damage and involvement of the medulla

Confidence Level: 85%

The imaging findings suggest a metabolic or genetic disorder affecting the white matter, with the spectroscopy findings supporting a metabolic abnormality. The symmetric nature of the abnormalities and the involvement of the basal ganglia and medulla are characteristic of certain metabolic disorders. The decreased NAA suggests neuronal loss or dysfunction, while the elevated Cho and lactate are indicative of demyelination and anaerobic metabolism, respectively. The specific pattern of white matter changes, along with the clinical presentation, is most suggestive of a leukodystrophy or mitochondrial disorder. It is crucial to correlate these imaging findings with clinical history, laboratory results, and potentially genetic testing for an accurate diagnosis.",85,Excellent
2022,Amyloid-Beta_related Angiitis (ABRA),"Based on the clinical presentation of a 64-year-old woman with left hemiparesis, left face and arm clonic seizures, worsening encephalopathy for 3 days, expressive aphasia, midline gaze with full extraocular movements, reduced muscle strength in the left arm and leg (grade 4 out of 5), and left-sided neglect, as described in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07072022, here are five differential diagnoses:

1. Ischemic stroke
2. Intracerebral hemorrhage
3. Brain tumor with associated edema
4. Central nervous system (CNS) infection (e.g., encephalitis, meningitis)
5. Autoimmune encephalitis

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07072022/tab-legends, which describes extensive white matter hyperintensities in the right frontal and parietal lobes with a 7-mm midline shift, no diffusion restriction, mild asymmetric leptomeningeal and dural enhancement in the right frontal lobe, scattered foci of susceptibility artifact in the right frontal lobe on GRE sequence, hypometabolic changes in the corresponding area on PET scan, dramatic radiologic improvement with resolution of the midline shift after steroid treatment, and pathology findings of markedly thickened and hyalinized cortical blood vessels with surrounding lymphocytic infiltrates and positive immunostaining for beta-amyloid, the differential diagnosis can be revised to reflect these specific findings:

1. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)-related inflammation
2. High-grade glioma with secondary inflammatory changes
3. Vasculitis (e.g., CNS vasculitis, primary angiitis of the central nervous system)
4. Infectious encephalitis with secondary vasculitis
5. Demyelinating disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis) with tumefactive lesions

Confidence Level: 90%

The imaging findings, particularly the extensive white matter hyperintensities with midline shift, the lack of diffusion restriction, and the dramatic response to steroid treatment, along with the pathology findings of amyloid deposition in the blood vessels, are highly suggestive of an inflammatory process associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy, known as CAA-related inflammation. This is a rare condition that can mimic high-grade glioma or CNS vasculitis. The pathology findings are particularly indicative of this diagnosis, as they show both the inflammatory component and the amyloid deposition characteristic of CAA. It is important to correlate these imaging and pathology findings with the clinical presentation for an accurate diagnosis.",90,Good
2022,Anterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery_Neurovascular Conflict (AICA_NVC) Causing Pulsatile Tinnitus,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 21-year-old woman with a 6-month history of right-sided pulsatile tinnitus, as described in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05052022, here are five differential diagnoses:

1. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)
2. Vascular loop syndrome (neurovascular compression)
3. Glomus jugulare tumor (paraganglioma)
4. Vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma)
5. Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) or dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF)

Confidence Level: 80%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05052022/tab-legends, which describes axial FIESTA images showing vascular looping around the right VII/VIII nerve complex extending to more than 50% of the right internal auditory canal, sagittal FIESTA images showing a vascular structure indenting on the cochlear and inferior vestibular nerves, and axial MR TOF angiogram images showing the right anterior inferior cerebellar artery looping around the right VII/VIII nerve complex in the right internal auditory canal, the differential diagnosis can be revised to reflect these specific findings:

1. Vascular loop syndrome (neurovascular compression) causing tinnitus and possible hemifacial spasm
2. Vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma) with associated vascular loop
3. Meningioma in the cerebellopontine angle with vascular involvement
4. Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) or dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) near the VII/VIII nerve complex
5. Other cerebellopontine angle tumors or cysts with secondary vascular compression

Confidence Level: 95%

The imaging findings are highly suggestive of a neurovascular conflict, where a blood vessel, in this case, the anterior inferior cerebellar artery, is compressing the VII/VIII nerve complex. This condition is often referred to as vascular loop syndrome or neurovascular compression and can lead to symptoms such as pulsatile tinnitus and hemifacial spasm. The detailed imaging description provided, showing the artery looping within the internal auditory canal and indenting on the nerves, supports this diagnosis. It is less likely that a tumor is causing these symptoms, given the specific description of the vascular loop, but tumors can sometimes be associated with vascular loops or cause secondary compression. The high confidence level reflects the specificity of the imaging findings that are characteristic of neurovascular compression.",95,Excellent
2022,ASL Hypoperfusion Artifacts after Carotid Stenting,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 67-year-old man with type II diabetes mellitus and ischemic heart disease presenting with recurrent episodes of visual disturbances and transient weakness of the right side of the body with slurring of speech, as described in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09222022, here are five differential diagnoses:

1. Transient ischemic attack (TIA)
2. Cerebral ischemia/stroke
3. Carotid artery stenosis
4. Amaurosis fugax (transient visual loss due to retinal ischemia)
5. Migraine with aura

Confidence Level: 80%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09222022/tab-legends, which describes tight stenosis at the left carotid bulb and ICA origin, poststenting DSA image showing opening up of the stenosed segment, ASL image with perfusion deficit in the left cerebral hemisphere due to stent-related artifacts, TOF angiography image and diffusion trace image showing filling of the left ICA and MCA without diffusion abnormality, and ASL image with labeling plane distal to the stent showing normal left cerebral perfusion, the differential diagnosis can be revised to reflect these specific findings:

1. Carotid artery stenosis with associated transient ischemic attacks (TIAs)
2. Cerebral ischemia/stroke with successful recanalization post-stenting
3. Carotid artery dissection
4. Hyperperfusion syndrome post-carotid intervention
5. Carotid atherosclerotic disease

Confidence Level: 95%

The imaging findings and clinical presentation are highly suggestive of carotid artery stenosis leading to cerebral ischemia, which is supported by the improvement in perfusion following stenting. The absence of diffusion abnormality on MRI indicates that there may not have been a completed stroke, or that the intervention was performed in a timely manner to prevent permanent ischemic damage. The patient's history of diabetes and ischemic heart disease also supports a diagnosis related to atherosclerotic vascular disease. The high confidence level reflects the clear correlation between the imaging findings, the clinical presentation, and the improvement post-intervention.",95,Insufficient
2022,Capecitabine-Induced Acute Toxic Leukoencephalopathy,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 59-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer who presents with loss of coordination, acute confusion, and muscle weakness after beginning treatment with capecitabine, as accessed from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12222022, here are five differential diagnoses:

1. Metastatic brain disease
2. Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis
3. Paraneoplastic neurological syndrome
4. Chemotherapy-induced encephalopathy
5. Stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic)

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12222022/tab-legends, which describes restricted diffusion along the bilateral corticospinal tracts including the bilateral centrum semiovale, corona radiata, and posterior limbs of the internal capsules, as well as involvement of the corpus callosum with a subtle high signal intensity on T2-weighted and FLAIR MRI without gadolinium enhancement, the differential diagnosis can be revised to reflect these specific findings:

1. Chemotherapy-related leukoencephalopathy (e.g., capecitabine-induced)
2. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)
3. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)
4. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)
5. Diffuse ischemic injury (e.g., hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy)

Confidence Level: 90%

The imaging findings of restricted diffusion without enhancement and the clinical context of recent chemotherapy initiation suggest a chemotherapy-related leukoencephalopathy, which can occur with agents such as capecitabine. The absence of gadolinium enhancement and the pattern of white matter involvement are less typical for metastatic disease or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. PRES can present with similar imaging findings but typically involves the parieto-occipital regions. ADEM and PML are less likely given the patient's history and the acute presentation. The high confidence level reflects the strong correlation between the imaging findings, the recent initiation of chemotherapy, and the clinical symptoms.",90,Excellent
2022,Carotid Web and Ischemic Stroke,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 47-year-old woman with no identified cardiovascular risk factors presenting to the emergency department with left-sided hemiparesis, numbness, facial drooping, and dysarthria, as described in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03242022, here are five differential diagnoses:

1. Ischemic stroke
2. Hemorrhagic stroke
3. Brain tumor causing mass effect and neurological deficits
4. Multiple sclerosis (MS) with an acute exacerbation
5. Central nervous system (CNS) infection (e.g., abscess or encephalitis)

Confidence Level: 80%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03242022/tab-legends, which describes an acute infarct in the right MCA distribution with associated T2 FLAIR hyperintensity and restricted diffusion, and axial CT angiography of the head revealing a thrombus within the superior division of the right MCA, as well as axial, oblique sagittal, and coronal CT angiography of the neck revealing a thin linear filling defect or septation along the posterior aspect of the carotid bulb, the differential diagnosis can be revised to reflect these specific findings:

1. Ischemic stroke due to thromboembolism
2. Carotid artery dissection
3. Atherosclerotic carotid artery disease
4. Cardiac source of embolism (e.g., atrial fibrillation)
5. Hypercoagulable state leading to thrombosis

Confidence Level: 95%

The imaging findings are highly suggestive of an ischemic stroke in the right MCA territory, likely due to a thromboembolic event given the presence of a thrombus in the MCA and a filling defect in the carotid bulb, which could represent a source of embolism or a dissection. The absence of cardiovascular risk factors in the patient's history may point towards less common causes of stroke, such as a hypercoagulable state or carotid dissection. The high confidence level reflects the strong correlation between the imaging findings and the clinical presentation indicative of an acute ischemic event.",95,Good
2022,Carotidynia or Transient Perivascular Inflammation of the Carotid Artery (TIPIC) Syndrome,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 44-year-old woman with 3 months of severe intermittent right neck pain, as described in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05262022, here are five differential diagnoses:

1. Carotidynia
2. Carotid artery dissection
3. Carotid artery aneurysm
4. Carotid atherosclerotic disease
5. Fibromuscular dysplasia

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05262022/tab-legends, which describes eccentric soft thickening surrounding the right common carotid artery extending up to the proximal third of the internal carotid artery, and follow-up MRI study demonstrating incomplete resolution of the soft tissue surrounding the right carotid artery with mild enhancement after gadolinium injection, the differential diagnosis can be revised to reflect these specific findings:

1. Carotidynia
2. Carotid artery dissection with associated inflammatory response
3. Carotid artery vasculitis (e.g., Takayasu arteritis, giant cell arteritis)
4. Carotid artery aneurysm with surrounding inflammation
5. Neoplastic processes involving the carotid sheath (e.g., carotid body tumor, lymphoma)

Confidence Level: 85%

The imaging findings suggest an inflammatory or neoplastic process affecting the carotid artery. The presence of eccentric soft thickening and mild enhancement after gadolinium injection is more suggestive of an inflammatory process such as vasculitis or carotidynia, rather than atherosclerotic disease. Carotid artery dissection is also a possibility, but the follow-up imaging showing incomplete resolution with persistent enhancement leans towards an ongoing inflammatory process. Neoplastic processes should be considered, but they are less likely given the lack of a discrete mass and the pattern of involvement. The high confidence level reflects the consideration of imaging characteristics and the clinical presentation, which suggest an inflammatory etiology.",85,Excellent
2022,Central Nervous System Tuberculosis Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 45-year-old man with HIV/AIDS, generalized weakness, headache, blurring of vision for 2 months, sputum positive for acid-fast bacilli, CSF analysis showing raised proteins, low glucose, and lymphonuclear pleocytosis, and a CD4 count of 68, as described in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04142022, here are five differential diagnoses:

1. Central nervous system (CNS) tuberculosis (TB)
2. Cryptococcal meningitis
3. CNS lymphoma
4. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)
5. Toxoplasmosis

Confidence Level: 85%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04142022/tab-legends, which describes initial imaging with coalescing ring-enhancing lesions in the right cerebellar hemisphere and no enhancing granulomas in the Sylvian fissure or exudate in the basal cisterns, and imaging after 1.5 months showing thicker walls of the cerebellar lesions, multiple solid and ring-enhancing granulomas in the suprasellar and left Sylvian cistern, and enhancing exudate along the surface of the midbrain and left Sylvian fissure, the differential diagnosis can be revised to reflect these specific findings:

1. CNS tuberculosis with progression despite treatment
2. Cryptococcal meningitis with associated complications
3. CNS lymphoma with new lesion development
4. Secondary infection or immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) post-ART initiation
5. Toxoplasmosis with atypical presentation or treatment failure

Confidence Level: 90%

The imaging findings and clinical context suggest a diagnosis of CNS tuberculosis, especially given the patient's positive sputum for acid-fast bacilli and the characteristic CSF findings. The worsening of the condition after 1.5 months of antitubercular therapy and ART initiation could indicate either a progression of the disease due to drug resistance or a paradoxical reaction known as IRIS, which can occur when the immune system begins to recover, leading to an inflammatory response against existing infections. The presence of new granulomas and enhancing exudate is concerning for either progression or a secondary complication. The high confidence level reflects the strong correlation between the imaging findings, the clinical presentation, and the known history of HIV/AIDS with low CD4 count.",90,Excellent
2022,Cervical Tumoral Calcinosis,"Based on the initial description provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08112022, a 75-year-old man with a history of trauma and treated prostate cancer, with an incidental finding on CT of the cervical spine, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Metastatic prostate cancer - Confidence level: 70%
2. Synovial cyst - Confidence level: 65%
3. Degenerative spondylosis with osteophyte formation - Confidence level: 60%
4. Calcified cervical disc herniation - Confidence level: 55%
5. Spinal meningioma - Confidence level: 50%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08112022/tab-legends, which describe a multiloculated, high-density lesion with peripheral calcifications related to the right C2/3 and C3/4 facet joints, extending along the lamina and into the right-sided neural foramen, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Tumoral calcinosis - Confidence level: 85% (given the high-density lesion with peripheral calcifications and absence of renal disease or hypercalcemia)
2. Synovial cyst with calcification - Confidence level: 75% (possible given the location but less likely due to the multiloculated nature and high density)
3. Calcified cervical disc herniation - Confidence level: 70% (considering the location but less typical for the described multiloculated appearance)
4. Spinal meningioma with calcifications - Confidence level: 65% (meningiomas can calcify but usually present as a solid mass)
5. Metastatic prostate cancer with unusual calcification - Confidence level: 60% (prostate cancer metastases can occur in the spine but typically do not present as multiloculated, calcified lesions)

The confidence levels are adjusted based on the imaging characteristics, which suggest a non-malignant process due to the well-defined nature of the calcifications and the absence of aggressive features. Tumoral calcinosis is a condition characterized by calcium deposition in periarticular soft tissues, which can present with similar imaging findings and is a strong consideration given the patient's normal serum calcium levels and renal function. Further clinical correlation and possibly a biopsy would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",85,Excellent
2022,CNS Posttransplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder (CNS-PTLD),"Based on the summary of the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08042022, a 45-year-old woman with a history of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis status post kidney transplant on immunosuppression presents with subacute weakness, paresthesias, and a shaking episode of her left arm. Here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) - Confidence level: 85%
2. Opportunistic brain infection (e.g., toxoplasmosis, fungal infection) - Confidence level: 80%
3. Metastatic disease - Confidence level: 70%
4. Primary CNS lymphoma - Confidence level: 75%
5. Cerebrovascular event (e.g., hemorrhagic stroke) - Confidence level: 65%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08042022/tab-legends, which describe a relatively hyperdense lesion in the right frontoparietal convexity with marked perifocal vasogenic edema, a marked T2-hypointense rim with corresponding susceptibility artifact, peripheral gT2 blackouth with central restriction on DWI, thick-walled ring enhancement on postcontrast imaging, and bilateral thick dural enhancement, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Cerebral toxoplasmosis - Confidence level: 90% (given the ring-enhancing lesions and immunosuppressed status)
2. Primary CNS lymphoma - Confidence level: 85% (common in immunocompromised patients, can present with ring-enhancing lesions)
3. PTLD - Confidence level: 80% (possible in post-transplant patients, can have varied imaging appearances)
4. Fungal infection (e.g., aspergillosis, cryptococcosis) - Confidence level: 75% (opportunistic infections are a risk in immunosuppressed patients)
5. Metastatic disease - Confidence level: 70% (less likely given the patient's known history, but still a consideration)

The confidence levels are adjusted based on the imaging characteristics and the patient's immunocompromised status, which increase the likelihood of opportunistic infections such as cerebral toxoplasmosis and fungal infections, as well as neoplastic processes like primary CNS lymphoma and PTLD. The presence of ring-enhancing lesions with a hypointense rim and dural enhancement is particularly suggestive of an infectious etiology. Further diagnostic workup, including serological tests and possibly biopsy or stereotactic aspiration of the lesions, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",90,Excellent
2022,Congenital Epulis,"Based on the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12152022, a 36-weeks' gestation female fetus is diagnosed with a mass protruding from the mouth. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for an oral cavity mass in a fetus:

1. Epignathus (teratoma of the oropharynx) - Confidence level: 90%
2. Hemangioma - Confidence level: 70%
3. Lymphangioma - Confidence level: 70%
4. Congenital epulis (neuromesenchymal tumor) - Confidence level: 80%
5. Macroglossia (associated with conditions like Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome) - Confidence level: 60%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12152022/tab-legends, which describe a T1-isointense, T2-hypointense homogeneous polypoid mass protruding from the anterior oral cavity, and postnatal imaging showing a lobulated mass presenting isointense signals to muscle, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Congenital epulis - Confidence level: 95% (given the isointense signal to muscle and typical location)
2. Epignathus (teratoma of the oropharynx) - Confidence level: 85% (teratomas are typically heterogeneous but can present as a protruding oral mass)
3. Hemangioma - Confidence level: 75% (common benign tumor in neonates, but would typically be hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging)
4. Lymphangioma - Confidence level: 75% (can present as a protruding mass, but usually has a more cystic appearance)
5. Rhabdomyoma - Confidence level: 70% (rare benign tumor of striated muscle that could present in the oral cavity)

The confidence levels are adjusted based on the imaging characteristics, which suggest a solid mass with muscle isointensity. Congenital epulis is a strong consideration due to its typical appearance and location. Epignathus is also a possibility but is usually more complex in appearance due to its teratomatous nature. Hemangiomas and lymphangiomas are less likely given the imaging characteristics. Rhabdomyoma is a rare possibility but should be considered due to the signal intensity. Further clinical evaluation and histopathological examination after birth would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",95,Excellent
2022,Dentatorubral-Pallidoluysian Atrophy (DRPLA),"Based on the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02242022, a 21-year-old Chinese man with an 11-year-long worsening of myoclonic epilepsy, ataxia, and cognitive impairment, and a family history of cerebellar atrophy and epilepsy, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

3. Friedreich's ataxia - Confidence level: 65%
4. Wilson's disease - Confidence level: 60%
5. Mitochondrial disorders (e.g., MELAS) - Confidence level: 55%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings and genetic test results from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02242022/tab-legends, which describe atrophy of the cerebellum, tegmentum, and dentate nuclei, and DNA analysis detecting pathologic 61 CAG repeats in one allele of the ATN1 gene, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) - Confidence level: 95% (given the genetic finding of abnormal CAG repeats in the ATN1 gene)
2. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) - Confidence level: 85% (also associated with CAG repeat expansions, but in a different gene)
3. Huntington's disease-like syndromes - Confidence level: 75% (these can present with similar symptoms and are also caused by CAG repeat expansions)
4. Other hereditary ataxias with known genetic mutations - Confidence level: 70% (considering the family history and progressive symptoms)
5. Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) - Confidence level: 65% (a group of disorders that include DRPLA and SCA3 among others)

The confidence levels are adjusted based on the specific genetic finding, which is pathognomonic for DRPLA, a condition characterized by CAG repeat expansions in the ATN1 gene. This genetic mutation correlates with the clinical presentation of myoclonic epilepsy, ataxia, and cognitive impairment, as well as the imaging findings of cerebellar and brainstem atrophy. DRPLA is a rare, hereditary neurodegenerative disorder that fits the clinical and genetic profile of the patient.",95,Excellent
2022,Disseminated Systemic Hydatidosis,"Based on the summary of the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09012022, a 59-year-old woman from the north of Argentina presents with dysuria, hematuria, pain in the flanks, asymmetry in the left thigh, and ipsilateral paresis and paresthesias for several months, along with a history of high blood pressure. Here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Metastatic disease - Confidence level: 75%
2. Spinal and pelvic infection (e.g., osteomyelitis, discitis, abscess) - Confidence level: 80%
3. Neurogenic tumor (e.g., schwannoma, neurofibroma) - Confidence level: 70%
4. Primary bone tumor (e.g., chondrosarcoma) - Confidence level: 65%
5. Inflammatory disease (e.g., sarcoidosis, rheumatoid arthritis) - Confidence level: 60%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09012022/tab-legends, which describe intermediate/hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted MRI with small cysts of predominantly peripheral location involving the L5-S1 disc, sacrum, and left iliac bone, with invasion of the spinal canal and contact with the left S1 nerve root, involvement of the posterior paraspinal and left psoas muscles, abdominal aorta, and both iliac arteries, as well as a hyperintense, multiseptated cystic lesion on the anterior aspect of the proximal left thigh, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Echinococcosis (hydatid disease) - Confidence level: 95% (given the multiseptated cystic lesions with daughter vesicles, which are characteristic of echinococcosis)
2. Metastatic disease - Confidence level: 75% (possible but less likely given the cystic nature of the lesions)
3. Tuberculosis (Pott's disease) - Confidence level: 80% (given the spinal involvement, but the presence of daughter cysts is more suggestive of echinococcosis)
4. Lymphoma - Confidence level: 70% (can present with widespread disease, but the cystic nature of the lesions is atypical)
5. Spinal and pelvic infection with abscess formation - Confidence level: 75% (infections can present with similar symptoms, but the imaging findings are more characteristic of echinococcosis)

The confidence levels are adjusted based on the imaging characteristics, which are highly suggestive of echinococcosis, especially in a patient from an endemic area like Argentina. The presence of cystic lesions with daughter vesicles is a hallmark of hydatid disease caused by the Echinococcus parasite. Further diagnostic workup, including serological tests and possibly biopsy or surgical intervention, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",95,Excellent
2022,Duplication of the Pituitary Gland (DPG)-Plus Syndrome,"Based on the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04072022, a 44-month-old girl initially presents with glial choristoma (""hairy polyp"") of the epipharynx and tongue and subsequent developmental delay.

1. Congenital brain malformation syndrome - Confidence level: 90%
2. Genetic syndrome with CNS involvement (e.g., Down syndrome, Trisomy 18) - Confidence level: 80%
3. Inborn errors of metabolism affecting the CNS - Confidence level: 70%
4. Pediatric brain tumor with secondary developmental impact - Confidence level: 60%
5. Postnatal infection or trauma leading to developmental delay - Confidence level: 50%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04072022/tab-legends, which describe nearly complete callosal agenesis with a small remnant of the genu, fused tuber cinereum creating a thickened floor of the third ventricle, absence of the gyrus cinguli, sinus sagittalis inferior lying upon the third ventricle, doubling of the superior cervical column and a ""steer horns"" configuration of the anterior ventricle horns, doubling of the pituitary stalk and body with bright neurohypophyses, and an isointense mass protruding through the hard palate, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Septo-optic dysplasia (De Morsier syndrome) - Confidence level: 95% (given the findings of callosal agenesis, pituitary abnormalities, and midline defects)
2. Aicardi syndrome - Confidence level: 85% (typically presents with callosal agenesis and other CNS abnormalities, but is usually seen in females)
3. Holoprosencephaly - Confidence level: 80% (associated with midline defects, but the imaging findings are not fully consistent with this diagnosis)
4. Schizencephaly - Confidence level: 75% (can present with callosal agenesis and developmental delay, but other findings are less typical)
5. Congenital brain malformation syndrome not otherwise specified - Confidence level: 70% (a broad category that could encompass the observed abnormalities)

The confidence levels are adjusted based on the specific imaging findings, which strongly suggest a diagnosis of Septo-optic dysplasia, a condition characterized by optic nerve hypoplasia, pituitary hormone abnormalities, and midline brain defects, including agenesis of the corpus callosum. The presence of a glial choristoma and the described imaging features support this diagnosis. Genetic testing and endocrinological evaluation would be helpful to confirm the diagnosis and guide management.",95,Insufficient
2022,Dural Venous Sinus Laceration Complicating Extradural Hematoma,"Based on the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06022022, a 15-year-old boy presents to the emergency department after being hit by a car while riding his bicycle, with symptoms of increasing headaches and vomiting since the accident, and clinical evidence of head trauma with a palpable hematoma in the left occipitoparietal region. Here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Extradural hematoma with associated skull fracture - Confidence level: 99% (given the direct imaging evidence of EDH and skull fracture)
2. Traumatic injury to the superior sagittal sinus with venous EDH - Confidence level: 95% (due to the compression of the sinus and contrast extravasation)
3. Cerebral contusion - Confidence level: 75% (possible in the context of head trauma, but less likely given the imaging findings)
4. Subdural hematoma - Confidence level: 70% (less likely due to the imaging characteristics favoring EDH)
5. Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage - Confidence level: 65% (possible but not directly indicated by the provided imaging)

The confidence levels are adjusted based on the imaging findings, which clearly indicate an extradural hematoma associated with a skull fracture and involvement of the superior sagittal sinus. The presence of active contrast extravasation suggests ongoing bleeding, which is a critical finding that may require urgent neurosurgical intervention. The high confidence level for the extradural hematoma with skull fracture reflects the strong correlation between the clinical presentation and the imaging evidence.",99,Excellent
2022,Erdheim-Chester Disease (ECD) with Involvement of the Central Nervous System,"Based on the summary of the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06302022, a 56-year-old woman presents with a several-year history of progressive dizziness, hearing loss, diplopia, gait instability, emotional lability, and fatigue.

Without specific imaging findings, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) - Given the history of visual loss and oculomotor nerve palsy, MS could be a consideration.
2. Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) - This condition can present with rapid visual loss and may involve the optic nerves and spinal cord.
3. Central Nervous System (CNS) Vasculitis - This could cause multifocal neurological deficits and visual disturbances.
4. Space-occupying lesions - Such as a brain tumor or abscess, which could compress the optic pathways or cranial nerves.
5. Infectious or inflammatory conditions - Such as sarcoidosis or infectious meningitis, which could affect the cranial nerves and visual pathways.

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04282022/tab-legends), which describes multifocal, ovoid, and juxtacortical deep, periventricular, and brainstem hyperintensities with surrounding edema, peripheral restricted diffusion on DWI, incomplete ring enhancement, and a large cavitation of lesions, as well as a ring-enhancing intramedullary lesion in the cervical spinal cord, the revised differential diagnoses with imaging correlation are:

1. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) - The presence of ovoid lesions perpendicular to the ventricles and ring-enhancing lesions are characteristic of MS.
2. Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) - The spinal cord lesion and visual symptoms could be consistent with NMO, although optic nerve involvement is more typical.
3. CNS Lymphoma - Can present with ring-enhancing lesions, although it is less likely given the pattern of the lesions.
4. Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) - This is less likely due to the presence of ring enhancement, but PML can present with multifocal white matter lesions.
5. CNS Sarcoidosis - Can cause a variety of CNS lesions, including ring-enhancing ones, and could be consistent with the patient's symptoms.

Confidence Level: 85%

It is important to note that the actual diagnosis would require a comprehensive clinical evaluation, including a detailed history, physical examination, and correlation with additional diagnostic tests such as laboratory results and potentially a biopsy.

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05122022/tab-legends), which describes a hyperdense bleed in the right parieto-temporal lobe with blood-fluid levels, a hyperintense expansile lesion with intralesional bleed, contiguous expansile lesion along the septum pellucidum, moderate mass effect, hydrocephalus, heterogeneous enhancement, elevated rCBV, and MRS findings of elevated choline and decreased NAA with a high Cho:NAA ratio, the revised differential diagnoses are:

1. High-grade glioma - The imaging findings of an expansile lesion with increased perfusion and elevated choline on MRS are suggestive of a high-grade glioma.
2. CNS lymphoma - This could present with similar imaging characteristics, especially in the context of a child with a history of leukemia.
3. Metastatic disease - Given the history of systemic malignancy, the possibility of CNS metastases should be considered.
4. Inflammatory or infectious process - While less likely, an abscess or granulomatous disease could potentially present with ring-enhancing lesions and elevated perfusion.
5. Vascular malformation with hemorrhage - The presence of blood-fluid levels could suggest a vascular etiology, although this is less consistent with the other imaging findings.

Confidence Level: 80%

The revised differential diagnosis takes into account the specific imaging characteristics provided, which are suggestive of a neoplastic process, likely a high-grade tumor given the elevated perfusion and MRS findings. The confidence levels reflect the increased specificity provided by the imaging findings, but a definitive diagnosis would require further clinical correlation and possibly biopsy.",80,Good
2022,Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome_Associated Encephalopathy,"Based on the content from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11032022), a 56-year-old woman presents with aphasia and acute encephalopathy, with negative initial head CT/CTP/CTA for acute infarction, hemorrhage, and major vessel occlusion. The patient also reports abdominal pain, diarrhea, and coffee ground emesis, with laboratory results indicating renal failure and thrombocytopenia, and stool analysis positive for Shiga toxin. Here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) - The combination of thrombocytopenia, renal failure, and neurological symptoms could suggest TTP.
2. Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) - Especially given the presence of Shiga toxin, which is often associated with HUS, a condition that can lead to renal failure and neurological symptoms.
3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) - This condition can cause widespread clotting and bleeding, leading to organ failure and neurological symptoms.
4. Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVST) - While imaging did not show major vessel occlusion, CVST can sometimes be subtle and lead to encephalopathy and focal neurological deficits.
5. Infectious Encephalitis - Given the gastrointestinal symptoms and acute encephalopathy, an infectious cause could be considered.

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11032022/tab-legends), which describes symmetric FLAIR hyperintensities within the lateral thalami, dorsomedial lentiform nuclei, dorsal midbrain involving the tectal plate and periaqueductal gray matter, and paramedian dorsal pons, with T2 shinethrough indicating vasogenic edema without diffusion restriction, the revised differential diagnoses are:

1. Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) - The imaging findings and clinical presentation, along with the positive Shiga toxin, strongly suggest HUS.
2. Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) - This is less likely given the clinical context, but ADEM can present with multifocal FLAIR hyperintensities and encephalopathy.
3. Metabolic Encephalopathy - Various metabolic disturbances can lead to symmetric brain lesions, although the presence of Shiga toxin makes this less likely.
4. Wernicke's Encephalopathy - Typically associated with thiamine deficiency, it can cause symmetric lesions in the thalamus and midbrain, but the clinical context is not typical for Wernicke's.
5. Mitochondrial Encephalopathy - Such as MELAS (Mitochondrial Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes), although the presentation is atypical.

Confidence Level: 90%

The revised differential diagnosis is more focused on HUS due to the combination of clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and characteristic imaging features. The confidence level is higher after reviewing the imaging findings, which provide additional support for the diagnosis of HUS.

1. Cerebral Vasculitis - The irregularities in arterial caliber and the pattern of lesions could suggest an inflammatory process affecting the blood vessels.
2. Herpes Simplex Encephalitis (HSE) - Typically affects the temporal lobes and can cause gyriform hyperintensities, although bilateral occipital involvement is less common.
3. Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) - Can cause vasogenic edema and diffusion restriction, often in a posterior distribution.
4. Gliomatosis Cerebri - A diffuse glial tumor that can cause widespread changes in the brain, although it is a rare condition.
5. Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) - A prion disease that can cause rapidly progressive dementia and characteristic MRI findings, but typically does not involve vascular irregularities.

Confidence Level: 85%

The revised differential diagnosis takes into account the specific imaging characteristics provided, which suggest a multifocal process with vascular involvement. The confidence level is higher after reviewing the imaging findings, which provide additional specificity.

5. Paraneoplastic syndrome - Confidence level: 65%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07282022/tab-legends, which describe bilateral hypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD) on MRI, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Hypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD) secondary to a lesion in the Guillain-Mollaret triangle - Confidence level: 95% (given the imaging findings and clinical presentation)
2. Brainstem stroke with secondary HOD - Confidence level: 90% (a stroke could initiate the degenerative process leading to HOD)
3. Post-infectious or post-inflammatory process leading to HOD - Confidence level: 85% (infections or inflammation can damage the brainstem and associated structures)
4. Paraneoplastic syndrome with brainstem involvement - Confidence level: 80% (could cause similar symptoms and secondary HOD)
5. Neurodegenerative disorder such as spinocerebellar ataxia - Confidence level: 75% (can present with ataxia and may involve the olivary nuclei)

The confidence levels are adjusted based on the imaging characteristics, which are highly suggestive of HOD, a rare condition that can occur after a lesion in the Guillain-Mollaret triangle, which includes the red nucleus, inferior olivary nucleus, and contralateral dentate nucleus. The presence of palatal myoclonus and ataxia is consistent with this diagnosis. Further investigation to identify the underlying cause of the HOD, such as a prior stroke, demyelinating lesion, or tumor, would be necessary to guide treatment.""",95,Excellent
2022,Idiopathic (Nonlesional) Bilateral Hypertrophic Olivary Degeneration,"Based on the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07282022, a 39-year-old woman presents with palatal myoclonus and ataxia. Here are five initial differential diagnoses:

2022,Immune Effector Cell_Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS),"Based on the initial presentation of a 76-year-old man with refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 1 month post CAR-T therapy, presenting with pancytopenia, aphasic speech, and left-sided hemiparesis, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. CAR-T cell therapy-related neurotoxicity - Confidence level: 90%
2. Central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma relapse - Confidence level: 85%
3. Stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) - Confidence level: 80%
4. CNS infection (e.g., opportunistic infection due to immunosuppression) - Confidence level: 75%
5. Metabolic encephalopathy (e.g., due to pancytopenia, electrolyte imbalance) - Confidence level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11102022/tab-legends, which describe hypodensities and restricted diffusion across vascular distributions in the gray and white matter, including the right frontal sulci, with normal MRA of the cerebral vessels, and postmortem glial fibrillary acidic protein 1000x image of the frontal cortex demonstrating clasmatodendrosis with beading and fragmentation of astrocytic processes, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. CAR-T cell therapy-related neurotoxicity (Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome, ICANS) - Confidence level: 95%
2. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) - Confidence level: 85%
3. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) - Confidence level: 80%
4. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) - Confidence level: 75%
5. Cerebral infarction due to hypercoagulability or embolic phenomena - Confidence level: 70%

The imaging findings of hypodensities and restricted diffusion without corresponding vascular occlusion on MRA, along with the patient's recent history of CAR-T therapy, suggest a high likelihood of CAR-T cell therapy-related neurotoxicity, which can present with diffuse cerebral edema and neurologic symptoms. The presence of clasmatodendrosis on histopathology supports a diagnosis of severe neurotoxicity leading to astrocytic damage. Other considerations such as PML and ADEM are less likely given the context of recent CAR-T therapy but should be considered in the differential diagnosis due to the patient's immunocompromised state. PRES typically presents with vasogenic edema predominantly in the posterior circulation territories, which does not fully match the imaging findings. Cerebral infarction is possible, especially considering the patient's age and cancer history, but the lack of vascular occlusion on MRA makes this less likely. Further clinical correlation, including a detailed review of the patient's treatment course and laboratory findings, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",95,Excellent
2022,Infectious Spondylodiscitis,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01062022, a 72-year-old man with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and new-onset back pain for the past 3 months, concerning for lymphoma relapse, here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Lymphoma relapse with spinal involvement - Confidence level: 90%
2. Metastatic disease to the spine from another primary cancer - Confidence level: 80%
3. Spinal infection such as discitis or osteomyelitis - Confidence level: 85%
4. Multiple myeloma with spinal involvement - Confidence level: 75%
5. Compression fracture with secondary changes - Confidence level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01062022/tab-legends, which describe intense uptake in the lower thoracic spine centered at the T9_10 disc on PET, endplate destruction at the site of tracer uptake on CT, abnormal signal low on T1 and high on STIR in the T9_10 disc and adjacent vertebral bodies, and postcontrast enhancement extending into the prevertebral and epidural spaces on MRI, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Spinal lymphoma (relapse or secondary) - Confidence level: 95%
2. Infectious spondylodiscitis (e.g., bacterial, tuberculous) - Confidence level: 90%
3. Metastatic disease with spinal involvement - Confidence level: 85%
4. Spinal epidural abscess - Confidence level: 80%
5. Vertebral osteomyelitis with discitis - Confidence level: 85%

The imaging findings of intense uptake on PET, endplate destruction, abnormal signal intensity in the disc and vertebral bodies, and postcontrast enhancement are highly suggestive of a neoplastic process, such as lymphoma relapse or secondary spinal lymphoma, especially given the patient's history. Infectious spondylodiscitis is also a strong consideration due to the enhancement pattern and endplate destruction, which can be seen in infections such as bacterial or tuberculous discitis. Metastatic disease is possible but less likely without a known primary cancer other than lymphoma. An epidural abscess could present similarly but would typically have a more localized collection of pus. Vertebral osteomyelitis with discitis could also present with these imaging features and should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Further evaluation, including biopsy and laboratory testing, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",95,Excellent
2022,Intracranial Fat Embolism in a Patient with Vertebral Body Infarctions Due to Sickle Cell Anemia,"Based on the initial presentation of a 29-year-old woman with a known hematologic disorder, altered level of consciousness, respiratory discomfort, and lumbar spine pain radiating to the lower limbs, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Spinal cord compression due to vertebral disease or malignancy - Confidence level: 80%
2. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) - Confidence level: 70%
3. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) - Confidence level: 75%
4. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) - Confidence level: 65%
5. Leukemic CNS infiltration - Confidence level: 85%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04212022/tab-legends, which describe multiple foci with hyperintensity in the white and gray matter of both hemispheres, especially in the splenium of the corpus callosum, countless microbleeds scattered throughout the brain parenchyma, foci of diffusion restriction in the white and gray matter of both hemispheres, and abnormal signal of bone marrow in the thoracic spine with areas compatible with bone infarctions, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Cerebral fat embolism syndrome - Confidence level: 95%
2. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with CNS involvement - Confidence level: 85%
3. Sickle cell crisis with CNS and bone marrow involvement - Confidence level: 80%
4. Leukemic CNS infiltration with hemorrhagic transformation - Confidence level: 90%
5. Metastatic disease with CNS and bone marrow involvement - Confidence level: 75%

The presence of multiple microbleeds, diffusion restriction, and bone marrow signal abnormalities, particularly in the context of a known hematologic disorder, raises the suspicion for cerebral fat embolism syndrome, which can occur after bone fractures or orthopedic procedures but may also be seen in the setting of bone marrow infarctions or reconversion. DIC is also a consideration given the widespread microbleeds and potential for thrombotic and hemorrhagic phenomena. Sickle cell crisis could present with similar findings if the patient has sickle cell disease. Leukemic CNS infiltration with hemorrhagic transformation is a strong consideration given the patient's hematologic history. Metastatic disease is less likely but should be considered if there is a known primary malignancy. Further clinical correlation, including detailed history, laboratory testing, and potentially bone marrow biopsy, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",95,Good
2022,Intramedullary Spinal Cord Abscess Secondary to Infected Congenital Dermal Sinus,"Based on the summary of the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08252022, a 12-month-old child presents with E. coli meningitis, relapse of fever during treatment, acute urinary retention, and lower extremity weakness, with an erythematous sacral dimple noted. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Spinal dysraphism with tethered cord syndrome - Confidence level: 85%
2. Spinal cord abscess or empyema - Confidence level: 80%
3. Spinal epidural abscess - Confidence level: 75%
4. Cauda equina syndrome secondary to infectious or inflammatory process - Confidence level: 70%
5. Myelitis related to bacterial meningitis - Confidence level: 65%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08252022/tab-legends, which describe a complex multicystic enhancing lesion filling the lumbar cistern, involving the cauda equina and extending into the spinal cord, a dilated, enhanced syrinx throughout the whole edematous thoracic spinal cord, and a hypoechoic linear tract extending from the tip of the sacrum to the indurated skin surface on ultrasound, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Spinal dysraphism with tethered cord syndrome and associated dermal sinus tract - Confidence level: 95%
2. Myelitis with abscess formation secondary to bacterial meningitis - Confidence level: 90%
3. Spinal arachnoiditis - Confidence level: 85%
4. Spinal cord tumor with secondary syrinx formation (e.g., astrocytoma, ependymoma) - Confidence level: 80%
5. Spinal tuberculosis (Pott disease) with abscess and syrinx - Confidence level: 75%

The presence of a complex multicystic lesion in the lumbar cistern, the involvement of the cauda equina, the dilated syrinx, and the sacral dermal sinus tract are highly suggestive of spinal dysraphism with tethered cord syndrome and an associated dermal sinus tract, which can predispose to recurrent infections and neurological deficits. The high confidence level for this diagnosis reflects the specific imaging findings and clinical presentation. Further evaluation, including surgical consultation and potentially surgical exploration, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and plan for appropriate management.",95,Good
2022,Intramedullary Spinal Cord Metastasis (ISCM) from Renal Cell Carcinoma,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12292022, a 45-year-old man with a history of renal cell carcinoma (nephrectomy 2 years earlier) presents with subacute onset of asymmetric flaccid paraparesis with signs of pyramidal tract dysfunction, a sensory level at L2, and urinary retention. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Spinal cord metastasis - Confidence level: 90%
2. Paraneoplastic myelopathy - Confidence level: 75%
3. Spinal cord infarction - Confidence level: 70%
4. Transverse myelitis - Confidence level: 65%
5. Spinal epidural abscess - Confidence level: 60%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12292022/tab-legends, which describe an intramedullary spinal cord lesion at T11_12 with intralesional hemorrhage, marked edema extending from T2 to the conus, a thin rim of more intense enhancement (rim sign), and ill-defined flame-shaped regions of enhancement at the superior and inferior margins of the lesion (flame sign), as well as two hemorrhagic lesions in the right temporal and left parietal lobes, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Metastatic disease with intramedullary spinal cord metastasis - Confidence level: 95%
2. Hemorrhagic primary spinal cord tumor (e.g., ependymoma, astrocytoma) - Confidence level: 85%
3. Spinal vascular malformation with hemorrhage (e.g., arteriovenous malformation, cavernoma) - Confidence level: 80%
4. Paraneoplastic myelopathy with associated hemorrhage - Confidence level: 75%
5. Inflammatory/demyelinating disease with hemorrhagic transformation (e.g., neuromyelitis optica) - Confidence level: 70%

The presence of an intramedullary spinal cord lesion with hemorrhage and the patient's history of renal cell carcinoma strongly suggest metastatic disease, particularly given the known propensity for renal cell carcinoma to cause hemorrhagic metastases. The rim and flame signs are suggestive of a neoplastic process, and the presence of multiple hemorrhagic lesions in the brain further supports the likelihood of metastatic disease. The high confidence level for metastatic disease reflects the specific imaging findings and the patient's oncological history. Further evaluation, including a full oncological workup and potentially biopsy of the spinal lesion, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",95,Excellent
2022,Intraventricular Pilocytic Astrocytoma with Subependymal Metastases,"Based on the summary of the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03032022, a 14-year-old boy presents with dizziness, vomiting, and headache for the past 6 months. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Brain tumor (e.g., astrocytoma, medulloblastoma) - Confidence level: 80%
2. Hydrocephalus - Confidence level: 75%
3. Intracranial cyst (e.g., arachnoid cyst) - Confidence level: 70%
4. Chiari malformation - Confidence level: 65%
5. Infectious or inflammatory CNS condition (e.g., encephalitis, meningitis) - Confidence level: 60%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03032022/tab-legends, which describe a FLAIR-hyperintense, intensely enhancing mass in the frontal horn of the left lateral ventricle without restricted diffusion, similar-intensity subependymal nodules lining both lateral ventricles, and mild hydrocephalus, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Central nervous system lymphoma - Confidence level: 85%
2. Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with tuberous sclerosis - Confidence level: 90%
3. Neurocytoma - Confidence level: 80%
4. Ependymoma - Confidence level: 75%
5. Infectious etiology with ventriculitis (e.g., tuberculosis, fungal infection) - Confidence level: 70%

The presence of a FLAIR-hyperintense, enhancing ventricular mass and subependymal nodules is highly suggestive of a SEGA, especially if there is an underlying diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis, which is known to present with such lesions. CNS lymphoma is also a consideration given the intense enhancement, but it is less common in this age group without immunodeficiency. Neurocytoma and ependymoma are other neoplastic considerations that can present with ventricular masses. An infectious etiology is less likely given the chronicity of symptoms and the imaging characteristics but should still be considered. Further clinical correlation, including a thorough clinical history and additional testing such as genetic testing for tuberous sclerosis, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",85,Insufficient
2022,L-2 Hydroxyglutaric Aciduria,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10202022, a 26-year-old woman with delayed psychomotor development and seizures starting at age 1, evolving to involuntary movements of the face and neck associated with spasticity of the lower limbs in the last 4 years, here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Cerebral palsy - Confidence level: 70%
2. Multiple sclerosis - Confidence level: 60%
3. Mitochondrial disorder - Confidence level: 65%
4. Hereditary spastic paraplegia - Confidence level: 75%
5. Wilson's disease - Confidence level: 55%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10202022/tab-legends, which describe confluent T2/FLAIR high signal intensity of the subcortical white matter with relative sparing of the periventricular white matter, homogeneous T2/FLAIR hyperintensity of the globus pallidus, caudate, and putamen lateral edges, homogeneous T2/FLAIR hyperintensity of the dentate nucleus, and single-voxel spectroscopy showing an anomalous 2.5-ppm peak (L-2 hydroxyglutarate), the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria - Confidence level: 95%
2. Leigh syndrome - Confidence level: 80%
3. Canavan disease - Confidence level: 75%
4. Alexander disease - Confidence level: 70%
5. Metachromatic leukodystrophy - Confidence level: 65%

The presence of an anomalous peak at 2.5 ppm on MR spectroscopy, which is indicative of L-2 hydroxyglutarate, along with the imaging findings and clinical presentation, strongly suggests L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, a rare neurometabolic disorder. This condition is characterized by the accumulation of L-2 hydroxyglutaric acid in the brain and other tissues, leading to progressive neurological deterioration. The other conditions listed are part of the differential diagnosis for leukodystrophies and metabolic disorders but are less likely given the specific spectroscopy finding. Further evaluation, including genetic testing and metabolic workup, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",95,Excellent
2022,Lead Encephalopathy,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02172022, a 71-year-old woman presents with a 3-month history of abdominal pain and confusion, mental confusion, diminished tendon reflexes, severe normocytic anemia, CSF showing albuminocytologic dissociation, and EMG demonstrating prolonged distal motor latencies, predominating in the legs. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Vitamin B12 deficiency - Confidence level: 85%
2. Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord - Confidence level: 80%
3. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) - Confidence level: 75%
4. Guillain-Barr_ syndrome - Confidence level: 70%
5. Neurosarcoidosis - Confidence level: 65%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02172022/tab-legends, which describe symmetric posterior white matter hyperintensities on T2WI and FLAIR, hypointensities on T1WI, no diffusion restriction of posterior white matter on DWI, and the peripheral blood smear revealing basophilic stippling of erythrocytes, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Lead poisoning - Confidence level: 95%
2. Vitamin B12 deficiency with subacute combined degeneration - Confidence level: 90%
3. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy - Confidence level: 85%
4. Toxic/metabolic encephalopathy - Confidence level: 80%
5. Central pontine myelinolysis - Confidence level: 75%

The presence of basophilic stippling on the peripheral blood smear is a classic sign of lead poisoning, which can cause both central and peripheral nervous system pathology, including white matter changes on MRI and a clinical picture of encephalopathy and anemia. Vitamin B12 deficiency is also a consideration due to the symmetric posterior white matter changes and the clinical presentation, but the basophilic stippling is more specific for lead poisoning. The other conditions listed are less likely given the specific combination of neuroimaging and hematological findings. Further clinical correlation, including a detailed exposure history and targeted laboratory testing, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",95,Excellent
2022,Levamisole Leukoencephalopathy,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10272022, a 30-year-old man presents with a 2-day history of headaches and malaise, found down by a roommate, and in the emergency department, he exhibits altered mental status, mutism, fever, tachycardia, hypertension, rigidity, hyperreflexia, and a purpuric rash. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Meningitis/encephalitis - Confidence level: 85%
2. Cerebral vasculitis - Confidence level: 75%
3. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) - Confidence level: 70%
4. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) - Confidence level: 80%
5. Serotonin syndrome - Confidence level: 65%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10272022/tab-legends, which describe multiple ovoid white matter lesions in the supratentorial subcortical and periventricular white matter throughout bilateral hemispheres, enhancement on contrast-enhanced axial T1WI, no intrinsic T1 shortening on T1 images prior to contrast, restricted diffusion along the periphery of the lesions on DWI with ADC map, and no hemorrhage on SWI, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) - Confidence level: 90%
2. Multiple sclerosis - Confidence level: 85%
3. Cerebral vasculitis - Confidence level: 80%
4. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) - Confidence level: 75%
5. Infectious encephalitis (e.g., viral, bacterial, fungal) - Confidence level: 80%

The imaging findings of multiple white matter lesions with enhancement and restricted diffusion suggest an inflammatory or demyelinating process. ADEM is a strong consideration given the acute presentation and the pattern of lesions. Multiple sclerosis is possible but less likely given the acute onset and systemic symptoms. Cerebral vasculitis could cause similar imaging findings but would typically present with more focal neurological deficits. PML usually occurs in immunocompromised patients and often does not enhance. Infectious encephalitis remains a differential diagnosis due to the fever and altered mental status. The clinical presentation, including systemic symptoms such as fever, rigidity, and purpuric rash, should prompt consideration of systemic inflammatory or infectious processes that may have CNS manifestations. Further clinical correlation, laboratory testing, and potentially lumbar puncture for CSF analysis would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",90,Insufficient
2022,Lipomyelocele with ossified dysraphic hamartoma,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11172022, a 6-month-old infant presents with a large swelling over the lower back that has been present since birth. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for this presentation:

1. Spina bifida with meningocele - Confidence level: 85%
2. Lipomyelomeningocele - Confidence level: 80%
3. Myelocystocele - Confidence level: 75%
4. Dermal sinus tract - Confidence level: 70%
5. Sacrococcygeal teratoma - Confidence level: 65%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11172022/tab-legends, which describe herniation of subcutaneous fat through spina bifida into the spinal canal, the placode-lipoma interface inside the spinal canal, a multifocal syrinx, herniated lipomatous tissue, and a hamartomatous well-formed corticated bone with articulation between two bones, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Lipomyelomeningocele - Confidence level: 95%
2. Spina bifida with meningocele and associated anomalies - Confidence level: 90%
3. Diastematomyelia with associated bony anomaly - Confidence level: 85%
4. Caudal regression syndrome with associated spinal anomalies - Confidence level: 80%
5. Segmental spinal dysgenesis - Confidence level: 75%

The imaging findings of a lipomatous mass with a placode-lipoma interface and herniation through a spinal defect, along with the presence of a syrinx and hamartomatous bone, are highly suggestive of a lipomyelomeningocele. This condition is a form of spina bifida where lipomatous tissue attaches to the spinal cord and can cause tethering, leading to neurological symptoms. The presence of well-formed corticated bones and articulation suggests complex spinal dysraphism, possibly with diastematomyelia or segmental spinal dysgenesis. The high confidence level for lipomyelomeningocele reflects the specific imaging findings that correlate with this diagnosis. Further clinical correlation and surgical consultation would be necessary for definitive diagnosis and management planning.",95,Excellent
2022,Methanol Toxicity,"Based on the summary of the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03102022, a 42-year-old man with a recent history of heavy smoking, COVID-19 infection, acute myocardial infarction treated with coronary stenting, severe metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, and acute pancreatitis presents with rapid neurologic deterioration. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for the neurologic findings:

1. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy - Confidence level: 90%
2. Metabolic encephalopathy secondary to severe metabolic acidosis and renal failure - Confidence level: 85%
3. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) related to acute hypertension or renal failure - Confidence level: 80%
4. Infectious encephalitis, considering the recent COVID-19 infection - Confidence level: 75%
5. Toxic encephalopathy related to substance abuse or medication - Confidence level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03102022/tab-legends, which describe symmetric hypodensity of the putamina and subcortical white matter on CT, T2-hyperintense signal abnormality in the same regions on MRI, no evidence of hemorrhage on susceptibility-weighted imaging, mixed diffusion signal changes in the putamina with areas of restricted and facilitated diffusion, and extensive hemorrhage in the areas of white matter injury on follow-up CT, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Methanol poisoning - Confidence level: 95%
2. Carbon monoxide poisoning - Confidence level: 85%
3. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) - Confidence level: 75%
4. Leigh syndrome - Confidence level: 70%
5. Wernicke encephalopathy - Confidence level: 65%

The imaging findings of bilateral putaminal and white matter changes, particularly with the development of hemorrhage, are suggestive of a toxic/metabolic etiology such as methanol poisoning, which can cause putaminal necrosis and subsequent hemorrhage. Carbon monoxide poisoning can also lead to bilateral basal ganglia and white matter lesions but is less likely to cause hemorrhage. ADEM is a consideration due to the multifocal nature of the lesions, but the clinical context makes it less likely. Leigh syndrome and Wernicke encephalopathy are less consistent with the acute hemorrhagic changes and the patient's clinical history. Given the severity of the systemic conditions and the rapid neurological decline, toxic ingestion or exposure should be highly suspected, and further clinical investigation, including toxicology screening, is warranted.",95,Excellent
2022,Myeloid Sarcoma of the Cavernous Sinus _ JAK2-Positive Myeloproliferative Disorder with Acute Myeloid Leukemia Transformation,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05192022, a 72-year-old woman presents with diplopia, headache, and right-sided periorbital pain. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Cavernous sinus thrombosis - Confidence level: 80%
2. Cavernous sinus tumor (e.g., meningioma, schwannoma) - Confidence level: 75%
3. Carotid-cavernous fistula - Confidence level: 70%
4. Inflammatory condition (e.g., Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, sarcoidosis) - Confidence level: 65%
5. Metastatic disease to the cavernous sinus - Confidence level: 60%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05192022/tab-legends, which describe a homogeneously enhancing, T2-hyperintense lesion within the right cavernous sinus with partial encasement of the right internal carotid artery (ICA), diffusion restriction within the lesion, patchy infiltrative regions of diffusion restriction throughout the calvarial marrow, absence of tracer accumulation within the lesion on 99mTc-red blood cell SPECT/CT delayed scan, moderately avid uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose on PET/CT, and a photomicrograph of cavernous sinus tissue obtained at autopsy showing diffuse proliferation of primitive myeloid cells, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Hematological malignancy (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma) - Confidence level: 95%
2. Metastatic disease with diffuse marrow involvement - Confidence level: 85%
3. Granulomatous disease with cavernous sinus involvement (e.g., sarcoidosis) - Confidence level: 75%
4. Infectious process with secondary involvement of the cavernous sinus (e.g., fungal, bacterial) - Confidence level: 70%
5. Primary central nervous system (CNS) tumor with secondary marrow involvement - Confidence level: 65%

The imaging findings, particularly the presence of primitive myeloid cells on histopathology, suggest a hematological malignancy such as leukemia or lymphoma with cavernous sinus and calvarial marrow involvement. The absence of tracer accumulation on SPECT/CT and the FDG uptake on PET/CT support a neoplastic process rather than an inflammatory or infectious one. The high confidence level for hematological malignancy reflects the specific imaging and histopathological findings that correlate with this diagnosis. Further evaluation, including hematological workup and correlation with clinical history, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.",90,Excellent
2022,Perioperative Ischemic Optic Neuropathy,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01132022, a 25-year-old man who underwent surgical resection for recurrent meningioma presents with bilateral painless blurry vision 2 weeks post-surgery. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Post-surgical inflammatory response - Confidence level: 75%
2. Radiation-induced optic neuropathy (if the patient received radiation therapy) - Confidence level: 70%
3. Meningioma recurrence with optic nerve involvement - Confidence level: 80%
4. Optic neuritis - Confidence level: 65%
5. Ischemic optic neuropathy - Confidence level: 60%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01132022/tab-legends, which describe high signal intensity in bilateral optic nerves on axial T2, hyperintense signal on axial FLAIR, enhancement of the optic nerves on T1 postcontrast images, and diffusion restriction in bilateral optic nerves on DWI and ADC, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Optic neuritis - Confidence level: 90%
2. Infectious optic neuropathy (e.g., viral, bacterial) - Confidence level: 85%
3. Neoplastic infiltration (e.g., leptomeningeal carcinomatosis) - Confidence level: 80%
4. Inflammatory optic neuropathy (e.g., sarcoidosis, autoimmune) - Confidence level: 75%
5. Ischemic optic neuropathy (e.g., anterior ischemic optic neuropathy) - Confidence level: 70%

The imaging findings of bilateral optic nerve swelling, enhancement, and diffusion restriction are suggestive of an inflammatory or infectious process such as optic neuritis. Neoplastic infiltration is also a consideration given the history of meningioma, although the bilateral and symmetric nature of the findings makes this less likely. Inflammatory causes such as sarcoidosis or other autoimmune conditions could present similarly and should be considered. Ischemic optic neuropathy is less likely given the diffusion restriction, which is not typical for ischemia. Further evaluation, including a detailed clinical history, laboratory testing, and potentially lumbar puncture for CSF analysis, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",90,Insufficient
2022,Postpartum Hypernatremic Osmotic Demyelination,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07142022, a 23-year-old postpartum woman presents with fever for 2 weeks followed by acute-onset paraparesis of bilateral lower limbs for 2 days and altered sensorium for 1 day, with serum sodium on admission being 160 mEq/L. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Central pontine myelinolysis - Confidence level: 85%
2. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) - Confidence level: 75%
3. Multiple sclerosis - Confidence level: 70%
4. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) - Confidence level: 65%
5. Infectious or autoimmune encephalitis - Confidence level: 60%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07142022/tab-legends, which describe symmetric hyperintensity in bilateral posterior limbs of the internal capsules, bilateral cerebral peduncles, and the splenium of the corpus callosum on T2-weighted images, mild restricted diffusion in the splenium of the corpus callosum on DWI and ADC images, and multiple microhemorrhages in the splenium on SWI, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Extrapontine myelinolysis - Confidence level: 90%
2. Marchiafava-Bignami disease - Confidence level: 80%
3. Susac syndrome - Confidence level: 75%
4. Metabolic/toxic encephalopathy (e.g., related to hypernatremia) - Confidence level: 85%
5. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) - Confidence level: 70%

The imaging findings of symmetric hyperintensities in the internal capsules, cerebral peduncles, and splenium, along with the clinical presentation of acute paraparesis and altered sensorium, are suggestive of a demyelinating process. The presence of hypernatremia raises the possibility of an osmotic demyelination syndrome, such as extrapontine myelinolysis. Marchiafava-Bignami disease is typically associated with chronic alcoholism and involves the corpus callosum, but it is less likely in this clinical context. Susac syndrome involves the triad of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions, and hearing loss, which does not fully match the presentation. Metabolic or toxic encephalopathy could be related to the severe hypernatremia. NMOSD is less likely given the absence of optic neuritis or longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions. Further clinical correlation, laboratory testing, and potentially a lumbar puncture would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",90,Excellent
2022,RANBP2 mutation-related Acute Necrotizing Encephalopathy Type 1 (ANE1),"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12082022, a 23-month-old girl presents with lethargy, fever, and altered mental status, with a family history of maternal relatives who died of similar symptoms in childhood. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Meningitis/encephalitis - Confidence level: 85%
2. Mitochondrial disorder - Confidence level: 70%
3. Inherited metabolic disorder - Confidence level: 75%
4. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) - Confidence level: 65%
5. Toxic ingestion or poisoning - Confidence level: 60%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12082022/tab-legends, which describe patchy hypodense changes within the bilateral thalami on CT, hyperintense signal on FLAIR, multifocal susceptibility artifacts on GRE, no contrast uptake on postcontrast T1WI, scattered areas of restricted diffusion on DWI, and additional similar diffusion-restricting lesions in the bilateral pons on DWI, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) - Confidence level: 90%
2. Inborn errors of metabolism (e.g., organic acidemias, urea cycle disorders) - Confidence level: 80%
3. Infectious encephalitis (e.g., viral, bacterial) - Confidence level: 85%
4. Leigh syndrome (subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy) - Confidence level: 75%
5. Osmotic demyelination syndrome - Confidence level: 70%

The imaging findings of bilateral thalamic lesions with restricted diffusion and the clinical presentation of acute encephalopathy with a familial history suggest a diagnosis of ANE, which is a rare but severe condition often triggered by viral infections and associated with a poor prognosis. Inborn errors of metabolism are also a consideration given the age and acute presentation, as well as the family history suggesting a possible genetic component. Infectious encephalitis remains a differential diagnosis due to fever and altered mental status. Leigh syndrome is a mitochondrial disorder that can present with bilateral lesions in the basal ganglia and brainstem, but it typically has a more chronic course. Osmotic demyelination syndrome is less likely in this age group and typically associated with rapid correction of hyponatremia. Further clinical evaluation, including metabolic workup and infectious disease testing, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",90,Good
2022,Respiratory Epithelial Adenomatoid Hamartoma (REAH),"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03312022, a 67-year-old woman presents with sensorineural hearing loss and dizziness. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma) - Confidence level: 80%
2. Meniere's disease - Confidence level: 70%
3. Labyrinthitis - Confidence level: 65%
4. Otosclerosis - Confidence level: 60%
5. Cerebrovascular accident (stroke) affecting the auditory pathway - Confidence level: 55%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03312022/tab-legends, which describe soft tissue widening the anterior bilateral olfactory clefts on noncontrast axial head CT (bone window) and discoid enhancing soft tissue within the bilateral olfactory clefts on sagittal, coronal, and axial T1 MPRAGE postcontrast images and coronal postcontrast CISS images, with correlative hyperintense signal on axial T2WI, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Sinonasal polyposis - Confidence level: 85%
2. Olfactory groove meningioma - Confidence level: 80%
3. Encephalocele - Confidence level: 75%
4. Inflammatory sinonasal disease (e.g., sarcoidosis, Wegener's granulomatosis) - Confidence level: 70%
5. Sinonasal carcinoma - Confidence level: 65%

The imaging findings of soft tissue widening in the olfactory clefts and the presence of enhancing tissue are suggestive of a mass or polypoid lesion in the sinonasal region. Sinonasal polyposis is a common cause of such findings and can be associated with sensorineural hearing loss due to Eustachian tube dysfunction. An olfactory groove meningioma could also present with similar imaging findings and may cause sensorineural hearing loss if it exerts mass effect on adjacent neural structures. Encephalocele is less likely but should be considered due to the location. Inflammatory diseases and sinonasal carcinoma are less common but possible given the patient's age and symptoms. Further evaluation, including endoscopic examination and potentially biopsy, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",85,Insufficient
2022,Rosette-Forming Glioneuronal Tumor: Hypothalamic Origin,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11242022, a 9-year-old boy presents with headache and blurring of vision. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Craniopharyngioma - Confidence level: 85%
2. Optic pathway glioma - Confidence level: 75%
3. Pituitary macroadenoma - Confidence level: 65%
4. Arachnoid cyst - Confidence level: 60%
5. Germinoma - Confidence level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11242022/tab-legends, which describe a large suprasellar third ventricular lesion that is T2 and FLAIR hyperintense, T1 isointense with few hemorrhagic foci, causing infiltration of the optic chiasm, mass effect over the septum pellucidum with dilation of lateral ventricles, no diffusion restriction, and postcontrast T1 images showing heterogeneous enhancement of the mass with nonenhancing areas and smooth enhancement thickening of the optic chiasm, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Craniopharyngioma - Confidence level: 90%
2. Germinoma - Confidence level: 85%
3. Optic pathway/hypothalamic glioma - Confidence level: 80%
4. Rathke's cleft cyst with atypical features - Confidence level: 75%
5. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) - Confidence level: 70%

The imaging characteristics, particularly the location in the suprasellar region, the presence of hemorrhagic foci, and the heterogeneous enhancement pattern, are highly suggestive of a craniopharyngioma, which is known to occur in this age group and location and can present with these imaging features. Germinoma is another important consideration given the age of the patient and the suprasellar location, although it typically shows more uniform enhancement. Optic pathway/hypothalamic gliomas are also a consideration due to the involvement of the optic chiasm, but they usually do not have hemorrhagic foci. Rathke's cleft cysts are typically nonenhancing but can have atypical presentations, and LCH can involve the hypothalamic-pituitary axis but would be less likely to present as a large third ventricular mass. Further evaluation, including endocrinological assessment and potentially biopsy, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",90,Insufficient
2022,Ruptured Dermoid Cyst at the Cervicomedullary Junction with Intraventricular Dissemination,"Based on the summary of the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06092022, a 30-year-old man presents with sudden-onset urinary retention followed by bilateral lower limb and right upper extremity weakness, and loss of sensation in the right upper arm and upper part of the chest. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Transverse myelitis - Confidence level: 85%
2. Spinal cord compression due to a mass lesion (e.g., tumor, abscess) - Confidence level: 75%
3. Multiple sclerosis - Confidence level: 70%
4. Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) - Confidence level: 65%
5. Spinal cord infarction - Confidence level: 60%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06092022/tab-legends, which describe abnormal, irregular, T1- and T2-hyperintense linear signal extending from the medulla oblongata throughout the visualized portion of the spinal cord, with the hyperintense signal suppressed on the STIR sequence, and serpiginous T1 hyperintensity along the medulla oblongata, as well as a CT brain showing a medullary junction lesion with internal fat contents and a fat-containing focus in a nondependent part of the right frontal horn of the lateral ventricle, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Intramedullary lipoma or lipomyelomeningocele - Confidence level: 90%
2. Spinal dermoid/epidermoid tumor - Confidence level: 80%
3. Spinal arteriovenous malformation (AVM) with associated gliosis or fat deposition - Confidence level: 70%
4. Tethered cord syndrome with associated lipoma - Confidence level: 85%
5. Spinal cord hamartoma - Confidence level: 75%

The presence of fat within the medullary junction lesion and in the lateral ventricle, along with the characteristic imaging findings, suggests a diagnosis related to fat-containing lesions such as an intramedullary lipoma or lipomyelomeningocele. These conditions can present with spinal cord symptoms due to mass effect or tethering of the spinal cord. The suppression of the signal on STIR sequence is consistent with fat content, which is typical for lipomas. The high confidence level for intramedullary lipoma or lipomyelomeningocele reflects the specific imaging findings that correlate with this diagnosis. Further clinical correlation and potentially surgical consultation would be necessary for definitive diagnosis and management planning.",90,Good
2022,Septo-Optic Dysplasia Syndrome,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02032022, a 47-year-old woman presents with a life-long history of seizures, panhypopituitarism, and blurry vision. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms and findings:

1. Septo-optic dysplasia - Confidence level: 90%
2. Pituitary adenoma with secondary effects - Confidence level: 60%
3. Craniopharyngioma - Confidence level: 55%
4. Congenital brain malformation (e.g., holoprosencephaly) - Confidence level: 70%
5. Brain tumor with secondary hydrocephalus - Confidence level: 50%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02032022/tab-legends, which describe hypoplasia of the optic nerves and chiasm, inferior-pointing anterior horns, a small pituitary gland, a large cleft through the left frontal lobe communicating with the lateral ventricle, absence of the septum pellucidum, and flattening of the roofs of the lateral ventricles, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Septo-optic dysplasia (de Morsier syndrome) - Confidence level: 95%
2. Holoprosencephaly spectrum disorder - Confidence level: 80%
3. Schizencephaly - Confidence level: 85%
4. Congenital hypopituitarism with associated brain malformations - Confidence level: 75%
5. Porencephaly - Confidence level: 70%

The combination of optic nerve hypoplasia, absence of the septum pellucidum, and the presence of a cleft in the frontal lobe is highly suggestive of septo-optic dysplasia, also known as de Morsier syndrome. This condition is characterized by the triad of optic nerve hypoplasia, pituitary hormone abnormalities, and midline brain defects. The imaging findings are quite specific for this diagnosis, which is why the confidence level is high. Holoprosencephaly and schizencephaly are part of the differential due to the presence of midline and clefting abnormalities, but the clinical history and imaging findings favor septo-optic dysplasia. Porencephaly may also present with brain clefts but typically does not include the combination of optic and pituitary abnormalities seen in this case.",95,Excellent
2022,Serous Fat Atrophy,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10132022/tab-legends, the imaging findings include subtly increased density with areas of lucency in the T3 vertebral body on CT, hyperintense T2 signal on STIR images, enhancement on T1 postcontrast images, and hypointense signal on T1-weighted images. A T3 bone biopsy shows lamellar bone and marrow with serous fat atrophy. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these findings:

1. Osteoporotic vertebral fracture - Confidence level: 70%
2. Metastatic disease - Confidence level: 65%
3. Hemangioma - Confidence level: 60%
4. Osteomyelitis/discitis - Confidence level: 55%
5. Primary bone tumor (e.g., plasmacytoma) - Confidence level: 50%

After reviewing the diagram description, which suggests atypical imaging features for isolated serous fat atrophy and may represent increased fibrosis/connective tissue, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Serous fat atrophy with secondary changes (e.g., fibrosis) - Confidence level: 80%
2. Osteoporotic vertebral fracture with atypical healing - Confidence level: 75%
3. Osteomyelitis with atypical imaging features - Confidence level: 70%
4. Metastatic disease with unusual presentation - Confidence level: 65%
5. Primary bone tumor with secondary changes - Confidence level: 60%

The biopsy findings of serous fat atrophy suggest a non-aggressive process, which may be associated with increased fibrosis or connective tissue changes, leading to the atypical enhancement pattern. While osteoporotic fractures are common and can present with increased T2 signal and enhancement, the lack of typical fracture lines and the biopsy findings make this less likely. Osteomyelitis and metastatic disease are also considerations but are less consistent with the biopsy results. Primary bone tumors could present with such imaging features, but again, the biopsy findings would typically show neoplastic cells, which are not described here. Further clinical correlation and follow-up imaging may be necessary to monitor for changes over time.",80,Excellent
2022,Spinal Gout Causing Spinal Cord Compression,"Based on the initial description provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09152022 and the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09152022/tab-legends, here are five differential diagnoses for the case of a 44-year-old man presenting with a fall due to leg weakness, a history of dragging his feet, and numbness of the soles of his feet:

1. Spinal metastatic disease - Confidence level: 85% (given the presence of multiple lesions with bone erosion and epidural extension)
2. Lymphoma involving the spine - Confidence level: 80% (can present with multiple lesions and bone involvement)
3. Infectious spondylodiscitis with epidural abscess - Confidence level: 75% (infection can cause bone erosion and soft tissue masses)
4. Spinal meningioma - Confidence level: 70% (typically presents as a single lesion but can be multiple and cause bone changes)
5. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) with neurofibromas - Confidence level: 65% (can present with multiple spinal lesions, although bone erosion is less common)

After reviewing the MRI and CT imaging findings, which describe discrete, low-signal, rounded soft-tissue lesions centered on the facet joints with extension into the posterior epidural space, cord edema at the level of the lower thoracic cord, and faintly mineralized, hyperdense soft-tissue lesions with bone erosion and severe vertebral canal narrowing, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Spinal metastatic disease - Confidence level: 90% (the presence of multiple lesions with bone erosion and mineralization is highly suggestive of metastases)
2. Lymphoma involving the spine - Confidence level: 85% (lymphoma can present with similar imaging findings, including bone erosion and epidural extension)
3. Spinal chordoma - Confidence level: 80% (chordomas can cause bone erosion and present with soft tissue masses, although they are typically midline)
4. Primary bone tumors with secondary spinal involvement (e.g., osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma) - Confidence level: 75% (primary bone tumors can cause similar imaging findings but are less common in the spine)
5. Tuberculosis of the spine (Pott's disease) - Confidence level: 70% (can cause bone erosion and soft tissue masses, but the mineralization pattern may differ)

The confidence levels are adjusted based on the imaging characteristics, which suggest aggressive lesions with bone involvement and potential for metastatic disease. The presence of faint mineralization within the lesions may also be seen in certain primary bone tumors or infections like tuberculosis. Further diagnostic workup, including biopsy and laboratory tests, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",90,Insufficient
2022,T2-Weighted Hypointensity in Partial Status Epilepticus,"Based on the summary of the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03172022), we have a case of a 67-year-old man with a history of postmalaria encephalitis who presents with acute behavioral changes and left-sided involuntary movements, and an EEG that fulfills criteria for epilepsia partialis continua. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for this case:

1. Recurrent postmalaria encephalitis or late sequelae
2. Cerebrovascular disease (e.g., stroke or transient ischemic attack)
3. Brain tumor or neoplasm
4. Autoimmune or paraneoplastic encephalitis
5. Central nervous system infection (e.g., viral encephalitis, bacterial abscess)

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional MRI findings from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03172022/tab-legends), which describe initial and follow-up brain MRI scans showing areas of low T2 signal intensity in the right temporoparietal region with faint gyriform enhancement and subsequent total remission of these areas with the appearance of T2 high signal areas suggestive of gliosis, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Gliosis secondary to previous inflammatory or ischemic event
2. Low-grade glioma or other slow-growing brain tumor with interval changes
3. Demyelinating disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis)
4. Focal cortical dysplasia or other developmental anomaly with associated epilepsy
5. Vascular malformation with associated gliosis or previous hemorrhage

Confidence Level: 85%

It is important to note that the confidence levels are based on the information provided and the typical presentation of such cases. A definitive diagnosis would require a comprehensive clinical evaluation, including a detailed history, physical examination, and correlation with the imaging findings, as well as potentially further diagnostic tests such as laboratory studies, biopsy, or additional imaging.",85,Insufficient
2022,Trousseau Syndrome,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 51-year-old woman with advanced metastatic breast cancer who presents with acute confusion, apraxia, aphasia, and loss of coordination, as described in the content from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01202022), here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Metastatic brain disease - Given the history of advanced breast cancer, the presence of multiple brain metastases could explain the acute neurological symptoms.
2. Cerebral infarction - Acute ischemic stroke could cause these symptoms, particularly if multiple vascular territories are involved.
3. Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis - Cancer cells spreading to the meninges can cause a variety of neurological symptoms.
4. Paraneoplastic neurological syndrome - An immune-mediated condition often associated with underlying malignancies that can affect the nervous system.
5. Central nervous system (CNS) infection - Although less likely in this context, infections can lead to confusion and coordination issues.

After reviewing the diagram description from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01202022/tab-legends), which mentions multiple areas of acute and subacute cytotoxic edema involving multiple vascular territories, supra- and infratentorial, restricted diffusion on ADC, high-signal areas on FLAIR corresponding to the infarctions, and multiple microbleeds scattered throughout the brain parenchyma, the differential diagnosis can be refined:

1. Cerebral infarction - The presence of acute and subacute infarcts in multiple vascular territories suggests a thromboembolic process, possibly due to hypercoagulability from cancer.
2. Cerebral vasculitis - Inflammation of the blood vessel walls can lead to infarcts and microbleeds.
3. Metastatic brain disease - Particularly if the metastases are causing vascular compromise or hemorrhage.
4. Coagulopathy - A condition such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) associated with malignancy could cause both infarcts and microbleeds.
5. Paraneoplastic neurological syndrome - Some paraneoplastic syndromes can lead to vascular or inflammatory brain lesions.

Given the imaging findings of multiple infarcts and microbleeds, along with the patient's history of advanced breast cancer, I would assign a confidence level of 85% to the revised differential diagnoses. This confidence level reflects the consideration of the imaging findings that are suggestive of a thromboembolic or coagulopathic process, which is consistent with the patient's known malignancy. However, further clinical correlation, laboratory tests, and possibly additional imaging would be required to reach a definitive diagnosis.",95,Excellent
2022,Tuberculosis Hypophysitis,"Based on the clinical history provided from the content at the link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07212022), a 53-year-old woman with a history of peritoneal tuberculosis presents with signs of raised intracranial pressure. Here are five initial differential diagnoses based on this presentation:

1. Tuberculous meningitis - Given the history of peritoneal tuberculosis, the patient could have CNS involvement.
2. Intracranial mass - Such as a meningioma or metastatic disease, which can cause raised intracranial pressure.
3. Brain abscess - A collection of pus within the brain parenchyma or meninges, which can be secondary to tuberculosis or other infections.
4. Hydrocephalus - An accumulation of CSF within the ventricles of the brain, which can cause increased intracranial pressure.
5. Pseudotumor cerebri (Idiopathic intracranial hypertension) - A condition with raised intracranial pressure without a clear cause.

After reviewing the diagram description from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07212022/tab-legends), which mentions an enlarged, globular, and heterogeneous pituitary gland with heterogeneous enhancement of the entire gland and infundibulum, absence of the posterior pituitary bright spot, and enhancing soft tissue extending into the retroclival space, right cavernous sinus, and Meckel cave, the differential diagnosis can be refined:

1. Pituitary macroadenoma - A benign tumor of the pituitary gland that can cause enlargement and heterogeneous enhancement.
2. Pituitary carcinoma - A rare malignant tumor of the pituitary gland, which can have similar imaging features to a macroadenoma but with more aggressive behavior.
3. Lymphocytic hypophysitis - An autoimmune inflammation of the pituitary gland, which can cause gland enlargement and enhancement.
4. Metastasis to the pituitary gland - Although rare, metastases can occur in the pituitary and mimic primary pituitary lesions.
5. Granulomatous disease involving the pituitary - Such as sarcoidosis or continuation of tuberculosis involvement, which can cause enlargement and abnormal enhancement.

Given the patient's history of tuberculosis and the imaging findings suggestive of a pituitary lesion with extrasellar extension, I would assign a confidence level of 75% to the revised differential diagnoses. This confidence level reflects the consideration of the patient's past medical history and the specific imaging findings, but definitive diagnosis would require further investigation, including laboratory tests, potentially biopsy, and correlation with clinical findings.",95,Excellent
2022,Tubulinopathy,"Based on the clinical history provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08182022), a 17-year-old boy is being evaluated for a seizure disorder. Without specific imaging findings, here are five initial differential diagnoses based on the clinical presentation of seizures:

1. Epilepsy - A broad diagnosis that encompasses various seizure disorders, which could be due to genetic, structural, metabolic, or unknown causes.
2. Brain tumor - Such as a low-grade glioma or ganglioglioma, which can present with seizures, especially in the temporal lobe.
3. Cerebral dysgenesis - Abnormal brain development, which can lead to epilepsy.
4. Vascular malformation - Such as arteriovenous malformation (AVM) or cavernoma, which can present with seizures due to hemorrhage or localized brain irritation.
5. Infectious or post-infectious encephalitis - Infections like herpes simplex virus or autoimmune responses to infection can cause seizures.

After reviewing the diagram description from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08182022/tab-legends), which mentions right basal ganglia dysmorphism with fusion of the caudate and putamen, the head of the right caudate nucleus protruding into the frontal horn, polymicrogyria-like cortical dysplasia in the right precuneus, paracentral lobule, and parafalcine frontal lobe, as well as right cerebellar hemisphere and superior vermis hypoplasia and dysplasia with a cleft, the differential diagnosis can be refined:

1. Focal cortical dysplasia - A localized malformation of cortical development, which can cause seizures and may be associated with other brain malformations.
2. Gray matter heterotopia - Neuronal migration disorders that can present with seizures and abnormal brain morphology.
3. Schizencephaly - A rare developmental disorder characterized by abnormal slits or clefts in the cerebral hemispheres, which can be associated with polymicrogyria and seizures.
4. Polymicrogyria - A condition characterized by abnormal layering of the cerebral cortex, which can cause seizures and is often associated with other brain malformations.
5. Lissencephaly - A brain malformation characterized by a lack of normal brain folds and grooves, which can be associated with seizures and other abnormalities described.

Given the detailed imaging findings that point towards a structural brain abnormality associated with seizure activity, I would assign a confidence level of 90% to the revised differential diagnoses. This confidence level reflects the specific imaging findings that are highly suggestive of a developmental brain disorder, which is consistent with the patient's presentation of seizures. However, the exact diagnosis would likely require further clinical correlation and possibly genetic testing to determine the underlying cause of the brain malformations.",85,Insufficient
2022,Wolfram Syndrome,"Based on the clinical history and imaging findings provided from the content at the link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10062022), a 35-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus since 3 years old, progressive bilateral optic atrophy, neurosensorial deafness, and myopathy, and who was admitted to the hospital because of an altered level of consciousness, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Mitochondrial disorder - The combination of diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, deafness, and myopathy suggests a possible mitochondrial disease, such as Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy or Kearns-Sayre syndrome.
2. Leukodystrophy - A group of disorders characterized by progressive degeneration of white matter, which could explain the MRI findings and the neurological symptoms.
3. Multiple sclerosis (MS) - An autoimmune disorder that can cause optic atrophy, white matter lesions, and various neurological deficits.
4. Neurodegenerative disorder - Such as spinocerebellar ataxias, which can present with a variety of symptoms including optic atrophy, myopathy, and brainstem/cerebellar atrophy.
5. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) - An autoimmune disorder affecting peripheral nerves, which can sometimes present with central nervous system involvement.

After reviewing the diagram description from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10062022/tab-legends), which mentions absent posterior pituitary bright spot, optic nerve atrophy and optic chiasm thinning, hyperintensity in bilateral peritrigonal white matter/optic radiations, and atrophy of the brainstem and middle cerebellar peduncles with areas of elevated signal intensity in the pons, the differential diagnosis can be refined:

1. Mitochondrial disorder - The MRI findings support a systemic disorder affecting multiple organ systems, which is consistent with mitochondrial diseases.
2. Wolfram syndrome (DIDMOAD) - Diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness are hallmarks of this genetic disorder, which could also explain the absent posterior pituitary bright spot and other brain findings.
3. Adrenoleukodystrophy - A peroxisomal disorder that can cause white matter changes and adrenal insufficiency, but less likely given the patient's age and lack of mention of adrenal issues.
4. Leukodystrophy - The MRI findings could still be consistent with various forms of leukodystrophy, which often present with white matter abnormalities.
5. Neurosarcoidosis - Can cause a wide range of CNS findings including optic nerve and brainstem involvement, but systemic symptoms of sarcoidosis are not mentioned.

Given the specific combination of systemic symptoms (diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, deafness, myopathy) and the MRI findings, I would assign a confidence level of 85% to the revised differential diagnoses. This confidence level reflects the consideration of both clinical and imaging findings, but definitive diagnosis would require further investigation, including genetic testing and possibly biopsy, to confirm the underlying condition.",95,Excellent
2021,18q Deletion Syndrome,"Based on the summary of the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09092021), we have a case of a 3-year-old boy with global psychomotor delay, bilateral hyperopia and left-eye strabismus, deafness with conformational ear changes, and bilateral convex feet. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for this case:

2. Congenital Rubella Syndrome
3. CHARGE syndrome (Coloboma, Heart defects, Atresia choanae, Retarded growth and development, Genital abnormalities, and Ear abnormalities)
4. Usher syndrome
5. Genetic white matter disorder (e.g., Leukodystrophy)

Confidence Level: 65%

After reviewing the additional information from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09092021/tab-legends), which describes the presence of bilateral stenosis of the bony portion of the external auditory canal and MRI findings suggestive of diffuse hypomyelination with normal basal ganglia signal intensity and volume, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. CHARGE syndrome, considering the ear anomalies and the possibility of other midline defects
2. Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease or another leukodystrophy, given the MRI findings of diffuse hypomyelination
3. Congenital CMV infection, which can present with hearing loss and white matter changes
4. Zellweger spectrum disorder, which includes a range of peroxisomal biogenesis disorders that can present with hypotonia, hearing loss, and white matter abnormalities
5. Cockayne syndrome, which can present with growth failure, neurological impairment, and characteristic facies, along with hearing loss

1. Dental abscess or odontogenic infection
2. Osteomyelitis of the mandible
3. Benign bone tumor (e.g., osteoma, fibrous dysplasia)
4. Malignant bone tumor (e.g., osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma)
5. Lymphatic malformation

Confidence Level: 50%

After reviewing the additional information from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12162021/tab-legends), which describes the CT findings of a heterogeneously enhancing solid lesion centered in the left body of the mandible with tooth root resorption, displacement, and cortical destruction, and the microscopic image findings consistent with ameloblastoma, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Ameloblastoma, given the imaging and histopathological findings described
2. Odontogenic keratocyst, which can present with aggressive features and root resorption
3. Central giant cell granuloma, which can cause bone destruction and tooth displacement
4. Ossifying fibroma, a benign fibro-osseous lesion that can affect the mandible
5. Squamous cell carcinoma arising from the mandible, although less common in this age group

Confidence Level: 90%

The confidence level is increased after reviewing the diagram description, which provides specific imaging and histopathological features that strongly suggest the diagnosis of ameloblastoma. The presence of peripheral palisading, reverse polarization, and stellate reticulum are characteristic of ameloblastoma. The confidence level is not 100% because, in medicine, diagnoses are typically confirmed with a comprehensive clinical correlation and sometimes additional testing.",90,Insufficient
2021,Anaplastic Neuroepithelial Tumor,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12092021, a 7-year-old girl presents with 5 months of intermittent nausea, vomiting, headache, and vision changes.

1. Migraine with aura
2. Intracranial hypertension
3. Hydrocephalus
4. Brain tumor
5. Cerebral abscess

Confidence Level: 60%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12092021/tab-legends, which describes a large heterogeneous mixed solid and cystic mass in the right parieto-occipital lobe with surrounding vasogenic edema, the differential diagnoses would be revised to consider:

1. High-grade glioma (such as glioblastoma multiforme)
2. Primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET)
3. Brain abscess with surrounding edema
4. Metastatic disease (less common in this age group)
5. Arteriovenous malformation with hemorrhage (considering the microhemorrhages)

The presence of a solid and cystic mass with vasogenic edema and speckled enhancement within the solid components of the lesion suggests a neoplastic process, with high-grade glioma being a strong consideration given the age and imaging characteristics.

Confidence Level: 85%

Please note that these differential diagnoses are based on the provided data and that actual clinical decision-making would require a thorough clinical evaluation and additional diagnostic testing.",85,Good
2021,Anti-Ma2 Antibody Paraneoplastic Encephalitis (Secondary to Mediastinal Seminoma),"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01072021, the case describes a 25-year-old man with a one-week history of decreased sense of smell and taste, increased appetite, asthenia, and erectile dysfunction.

1. Hypopituitarism
2. Kallmann Syndrome
3. Zinc Deficiency
4. Adrenal Insufficiency
5. Chronic Sinusitis or Upper Respiratory Infection

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01072021/tab-legends, which describes bilateral hyperdense areas in the anteromedial region of both temporal lobes, increased signal intensity and bilateral enlargement of the amygdalae, signal abnormality extending along the optic tracts, hypothalamus, around the anterior commissure, and column of fornices, and an anterior mediastinal mass with increased metabolic activity, the differential diagnoses would be revised to consider:

1. Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis
2. Neurosarcoidosis
3. Lymphoma
4. Infectious or inflammatory processes such as herpes encephalitis or autoimmune encephalitis
5. Metastatic disease with associated paraneoplastic syndrome

The presence of an anterior mediastinal mass with increased metabolic activity and the bilateral and symmetric involvement of the brain structures, particularly the amygdalae, suggest a paraneoplastic process as a strong possibility.

Confidence Level: 85% 

Please note that these differential diagnoses are hypothetical and based on the provided data. Actual clinical decision-making would require a thorough clinical evaluation and additional diagnostic testing.",85,Good
2021,Anti-NMDA Encephalitis,"Based on the summary of the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01142021), we have a case of an 11-year-old boy with fever, malaise, encephalopathy, and generalized seizures, with an extensive viral panel including herpes being negative. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for this case:

1. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)
2. Autoimmune encephalitis (e.g., anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis)
3. Meningoencephalitis of non-viral etiology (e.g., bacterial, fungal, or parasitic)
4. Primary central nervous system vasculitis
5. Rasmussen encephalitis

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional information from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01142021/tab-legends), which describes MRI findings of subtle cortical hyperintensity and thickening in the right frontal lobe and cingulate gyrus, with progression to more pronounced signal abnormality and gyral swelling in multiple lobes and bilateral hippocampi, without evidence of enhancement on postcontrast T1 images, and mild restricted diffusion in the right frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), given the multifocal brain involvement and clinical presentation
2. Limbic encephalitis, considering the involvement of the hippocampi and the lack of enhancement
3. Hashimoto's encephalopathy, which can present with seizures, encephalopathy, and may show similar MRI findings
4. Infectious encephalitis with a negative initial viral panel, considering atypical or slow-growing pathogens
5. Metabolic encephalopathy, such as mitochondrial disorders or urea cycle disorders, which can present with acute neurological deterioration

Confidence Level: 80%

The confidence level is increased after reviewing the imaging findings, which suggest a more diffuse inflammatory or encephalitic process, possibly of autoimmune or atypical infectious origin. The lack of enhancement and the presence of restricted diffusion are important clues that help narrow down the differential. However, further diagnostic workup, including cerebrospinal fluid analysis, additional serological testing, and possibly a brain biopsy, would be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis.",80,Excellent
2021,Autosomal Recessive Spastic Ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS),"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12302021), we have a case of a 12-year-old boy with a chronic condition that started at 13 months of age presenting as difficulty balancing, which led to increasing falls; over the years, the patient developed cerebellar ataxia and hyperreflexia in the lower extremities. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for this case:

1. Friedreich's ataxia
2. Ataxia-telangiectasia
3. Cerebellar hypoplasia or atrophy syndromes
4. Spinocerebellar ataxia
5. Wilson's disease

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional information from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12302021/tab-legends), which describes MRI findings including moderate superior cerebellar vermis atrophy, hypointense pontine striations, subtle linear hyperintense signal medial to the posterior limb of the corticospinal tracts, lateral pontine hyperintensity extending into bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles, and no evidence of hemorrhage on SWI, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Metabolic or mitochondrial disorders (e.g., Leigh syndrome, mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS))
2. Leukodystrophies (e.g., Alexander disease, which can present with atrophy and signal changes in the cerebellum and brainstem)
3. Lysosomal storage diseases (e.g., Niemann-Pick disease type C, which can present with cerebellar atrophy and movement disorders)
4. Inherited ataxias (e.g., Friedreich's ataxia, considering the chronic progression and cerebellar findings)
5. Chronic small vessel ischemic changes, although less common in this age group, could theoretically cause progressive symptoms and atrophy

Confidence Level: 80%

The confidence level is increased after reviewing the imaging findings, which suggest a more specific pattern of neurodegeneration or metabolic disorder. The presence of cerebellar vermis atrophy and the specific pattern of signal abnormalities in the brainstem and basal ganglia are particularly suggestive of a metabolic or mitochondrial disorder. However, a definitive diagnosis would likely require further investigation, including metabolic studies, genetic testing, and possibly a biopsy.",80,Insufficient
2021,Basal Meningitis with Isolated Unilateral Basal Vein of Rosenthal Thrombosis,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05272021), we have a case of a 35-year-old man with HIV presenting with a 20-year history of fever and persistent vomiting and right-sided weakness for 3 days. His CD4 count was 24 cells/mm3, and CSF examination revealed high protein, reduced glucose, normal chloride level, and many lymphomononuclear cells and neutrophils with few RBCs. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for this case:

1. Central nervous system (CNS) toxoplasmosis
2. Primary CNS lymphoma
3. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)
4. Cryptococcal meningitis
5. Tuberculous meningitis or CNS tuberculosis

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the additional information from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05272021/tab-legends), which describes MRI findings of abnormal hyperintensity involving the left medial temporal lobe, hippocampus, left thalamus, and left cerebral peduncle, with restriction on DWI, blooming on SWI in the left basal vein of Rosenthal, and extensive leptomeningeal enhancement, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), given the filling defect in the left basal vein of Rosenthal and signal abnormalities
2. CNS toxoplasmosis, considering the patient's immunocompromised status and the presence of ring-enhancing lesions
3. CNS lymphoma, which can present with similar imaging findings in an HIV-positive patient
4. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis, given the involvement of the medial temporal lobe, although less common in HIV patients with low CD4 counts
5. Cryptococcal meningitis, which can cause leptomeningeal enhancement and may present with focal neurological deficits

Confidence Level: 85%

The confidence level is increased after reviewing the imaging findings, which suggest a vascular event such as CVST, in addition to considering the patient's immunocompromised status, which makes opportunistic infections like toxoplasmosis and lymphoma more likely. The presence of leptomeningeal enhancement and the specific imaging characteristics help narrow down the differential. However, a definitive diagnosis would require further investigation, including potentially additional imaging, laboratory studies, and possibly a biopsy.",85,Good
2021,Brain-in-Brain Malformation,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05202021), we have a case of a 2-day-old neonate with hypotelorism, limb malformations, low ear implantation, cleft lip, and cleft palate.

2. Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome)
3. 4p- syndrome (Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome)
4. Holoprosencephaly
5. Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge syndrome)

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional information from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05202021/tab-legends), which describes MRI findings of an anterior midline interhemispheric mass with gray and white matter components extending towards the third ventricle, a single dysplastic ventricular cavity, fused thalami, a heterotopic nodule in the right part of the ventricular cavity, an azygos anterior cerebral artery, and a cleft lip and palate, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Holoprosencephaly, given the fused thalami and midline abnormalities
2. Chromosomal abnormality syndromes associated with midline defects and holoprosencephaly, such as Trisomy 13 or Trisomy 18
3. Septo-optic dysplasia, considering the midline defects and possible optic nerve involvement
4. Schizencephaly, which can present with clefts in the cerebral hemispheres
5. Agenesis of the corpus callosum, although this condition typically presents with different imaging findings, it can be associated with other midline defects

Confidence Level: 85%

The confidence level is increased after reviewing the imaging findings, which suggest a significant midline defect consistent with holoprosencephaly and associated brain malformations. The presence of a cleft lip and palate, hypotelorism, and limb malformations further supports a diagnosis of a severe developmental disorder, likely with a genetic basis. However, a definitive diagnosis would likely require genetic testing and further clinical correlation.",85,Good
2021,Canavan Disease,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09022021), we have a case of a 4-month-old infant with poor head control and hypertonia in the extremities. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for this case:

1. Cerebral palsy
2. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy
3. Metabolic disorder (e.g., leukodystrophy)
4. Genetic or chromosomal abnormality (e.g., Down syndrome, Rett syndrome)
5. Infection-related encephalopathy (e.g., congenital CMV, herpes simplex virus)

Confidence Level: 60%

After reviewing the additional information from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09022021/tab-legends), which describes MRI findings of diffuse parenchymal swelling and white matter hyperintensity with involvement of the U-fibers, globi pallidi, and thalami, as well as involvement of the brainstem, dentate nuclei, and deep cerebellar white matter, and increased diffusion in the subcortical white matter bilaterally, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Metabolic disorders, specifically leukodystrophies or mitochondrial diseases, given the diffuse white matter changes and involvement of deep gray structures
2. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), considering the extensive white matter involvement
3. Inborn errors of metabolism (e.g., Canavan disease, Alexander disease), which can present with diffuse white matter abnormalities and increased NAA on MRS
4. Infectious encephalitis, although less likely given the pattern of involvement and MRS findings
5. Hypoxic-ischemic injury, which can cause diffuse brain damage, but typically has a different pattern on imaging

Confidence Level: 80%

The confidence level is increased after reviewing the imaging findings, which suggest a diffuse process affecting the white matter with specific involvement of certain structures that are more indicative of a metabolic or leukodystrophic process. The markedly elevated NAA on MRS is particularly suggestive of Canavan disease, which is a leukodystrophy characterized by elevated NAA levels. However, a definitive diagnosis would require further investigation, including metabolic studies and genetic testing.",80,Excellent
2021,Central-Variant Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES),"Based on the provided content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11252021, we have a case involving an 85-year-old nonverbal woman with altered mental status, right-sided weakness, and seizure. Without imaging findings, we can initially propose a broad range of differential diagnoses that could potentially explain these clinical features:

1. Ischemic stroke
2. Intracranial hemorrhage
3. Brain tumor (primary or metastatic)
4. Central nervous system (CNS) infection (e.g., abscess, encephalitis)
5. Demyelinating disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11252021/tab-legends, which describes the MRI findings, we can refine our differential diagnoses. The imaging findings include:

- Normal signal on Axial DWI (A)
- Expansile increased signal hyperintensity of the pons on Axial FLAIR (B)
- Additional nonexpansile signal of the midbrain (C, arrow) and occipital lobe white matter (oval)
- No evidence of hemorrhage on Axial GRE (D)
- Expansile signal change corroborated on Axial T2 (E)
- Punctate foci of enhancement within the central pons on Sagittal postcontrast MPRAGE (F)

Given these imaging characteristics, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Central pontine myelinolysis
2. Pontine glioma
3. Demyelinating disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis)
4. Brainstem encephalitis
5. Metabolic or toxic encephalopathy (considering the absence of hemorrhage and the pattern of signal changes)

The confidence level in this revised differential diagnosis is approximately 75%. This confidence level is based on the typical imaging features associated with these conditions, but it is important to note that further clinical correlation, laboratory tests, and potentially additional imaging (such as with contrast or different sequences) would be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis.",75,Insufficient

1. Ischemic stroke
2. Hemorrhagic stroke
3. Vestibular neuritis
4. Labyrinthitis
5. Transient ischemic attack (TIA)

After reviewing the imaging findings described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04082021/tab-legends, which include the new appearance of numerous peripherally located microbleeds predominantly in bilateral parietal lobes and T2 FLAIR hyperintense signal in the left parietal white matter without associated diffusion restriction, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)
2. Multiple microhemorrhages secondary to hypertension
3. Cerebral vasculitis
4. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)
5. Cerebral venous thrombosis

The presence of microbleeds and T2 FLAIR hyperintense signal without diffusion restriction suggests a process that may involve small vessel disease or other vascular abnormalities rather than a large vessel occlusion typically seen in acute ischemic stroke.

The confidence level in this revised differential diagnosis is approximately 80%. This confidence level takes into account the imaging findings that are characteristic of small vessel disease processes, such as CAA or hypertensive microangiopathy, but it is important to note that further clinical correlation and possibly additional diagnostic tests (such as lumbar puncture, blood tests, or angiography) would be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis.",80,Good
2021,Cochlear Incomplete Partition Type II and Large Vestibular Aqueduct,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 20-year-old woman with progressive sensorineural hearing loss of the right ear without traumatic history, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08052021, here are five potential differential diagnoses:

2. Large vestibular aqueduct syndrome (LVAS)
3. Incomplete partition type II (IP-II, also known as Mondini dysplasia)
4. Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection
5. Otosyphilis

The imaging findings suggest a congenital or developmental abnormality, particularly with the cystic appearance of the cochlear apex and the dilated vestibular aqueduct.

The confidence level in this revised differential diagnosis is approximately 85%. This confidence level is based on the imaging characteristics that are suggestive of congenital or developmental anomalies of the inner ear, which are known to be associated with sensorineural hearing loss. However, further clinical correlation, genetic testing, and possibly additional imaging or laboratory tests would be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis.",85,Excellent
2021,Congenital Cytomegalovirus Infection,"Based on the clinical presentation of an 11-month-old female infant with developmental delay, microcephaly, hypotonia in all four limbs, and inability to hold her neck, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10282021, here are five potential differential diagnoses:

After reviewing the imaging findings described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10282021/tab-legends, which include hyperintensity in subcortical white matter of bilateral anterior temporal poles with cysts, vacuolization in the anterior temporal region, patchy hyperintensity in bilateral corona radiata and subcortical U-fibers, and a focus of blooming along the margin of the left lateral ventricle due to calcification, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Congenital infection (e.g., cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis) with resultant brain calcifications
2. Leukodystrophy (e.g., Alexander disease, Canavan disease)
3. Mitochondrial disorder (e.g., Leigh syndrome)
4. Storage disorder (e.g., Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease)
5. Aicardi-Gouti_res syndrome

The imaging findings suggest a possible neurodegenerative or metabolic disorder, with white matter abnormalities and calcifications being indicative of a possible congenital infection or a genetic metabolic disorder.

The confidence level in this revised differential diagnosis is approximately 70%. This confidence level reflects the complexity of the case and the broad range of potential diagnoses that could explain the imaging and clinical findings. Further diagnostic workup, including metabolic screening, genetic testing, and possibly infectious disease serology, would be necessary to narrow down the diagnosis and reach a definitive conclusion.",70,Excellent
2021,Critical Illness_Associated Microbleeds,"Based on the clinical history of a 63-year-old woman found unresponsive and in respiratory arrest following attempted suicide by self-asphyxiation, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09302021, here are five potential differential diagnoses:

1. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy

5. Central pontine myelinolysis

After reviewing the imaging findings described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09302021/tab-legends, which include small foci of hyperdensity within the splenium of the corpus callosum, swollen and hyperintense corpus callosum with small foci of T2 hypointensity, further foci of T2 hyperintensity within the subcortical white matter, and multiple small foci of susceptibility in the juxtacortical white matter, corpus callosum, internal and external capsules, pons, and cerebellar peduncles, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy
2. Cerebral fat embolism
3. Diffuse axonal injury
4. Cerebral microhemorrhages (secondary to traumatic or anoxic injury)
5. Thrombotic microangiopathy (e.g., disseminated intravascular coagulation)

The imaging findings suggest a process that has resulted in both white matter changes and microhemorrhages, which could be consistent with a hypoxic-ischemic event and secondary microvascular injury, possibly related to the patient's history of self-asphyxiation and subsequent hypoxia.

The confidence level in this revised differential diagnosis is approximately 80%. This confidence level reflects the correlation between the patient's clinical history and the imaging findings, which are suggestive of hypoxic-ischemic injury and its complications. However, the differential remains broad due to the nonspecific nature of the imaging findings, and further clinical correlation and possibly additional diagnostic tests would be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis.",80,Good
2021,Drug-Induced Intracranial Hypertension,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 27-year-old woman with promyelocytic leukemia presenting with headache and diplopia after all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02182021, here are five potential differential diagnoses:

1. Pseudotumor cerebri (idiopathic intracranial hypertension)
2. Leukemic meningitis
3. Thrombosis of the cerebral venous sinuses
4. Medication-induced headache (secondary to ATRA therapy)
5. Intracranial hemorrhage or ischemia

After reviewing the imaging findings described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02182021/tab-legends, which include distended optic nerve sheaths, bilateral stenosis of the transverse-sigmoid junction, mild flattening of the pituitary gland, normalization of perioptic CSF spaces, appearance of subdural effusions, resolution of dural venous sinus stenosis, and neuroradiologic signs of intracranial hypotension, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Pseudotumor cerebri (idiopathic intracranial hypertension)
2. Secondary intracranial hypertension due to venous sinus thrombosis
3. Intracranial hypotension post-lumbar puncture
4. Medication-induced intracranial hypertension (secondary to ATRA therapy)
5. Subdural hematoma or effusion

The imaging findings suggest a dynamic process with initial signs of increased intracranial pressure, followed by treatment and subsequent imaging that suggests intracranial hypotension, possibly as a result of the therapeutic interventions.

The confidence level in this revised differential diagnosis is approximately 90%. This confidence level reflects the clear imaging findings that are consistent with changes in intracranial pressure, both increased and decreased, and the temporal relationship with the patient's treatment. The resolution of symptoms after discontinuation of ATRA and therapeutic interventions further supports the diagnosis. However, it is important to note that the definitive diagnosis would require clinical correlation and consideration of the patient's full medical history and treatment course.",90,Excellent
2021,Extradural Spinal Hemangioblastoma,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02042021), we have a case involving a 40-year-old man with back pain and abnormal gait. However, without specific imaging findings or additional clinical details, it is challenging to provide an accurate differential diagnosis. Nonetheless, here are five general differential diagnoses for a patient presenting with back pain and abnormal gait:

1. Lumbar disc herniation
2. Spinal stenosis
3. Spinal tumor (primary or metastatic)
4. Vertebral fracture
5. Inflammatory or infectious conditions (e.g., spondylitis, epidural abscess)

Confidence Level: 60%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02042021/tab-legends), which describes a large, avidly enhancing, well-defined mass on the left lateral aspect of the spinal canal with adjacent bone remodeling, paraspinal extension, and evidence of arteriovenous (AV) shunting, the differential diagnosis can be refined:

1. Spinal meningioma
2. Nerve sheath tumor (e.g., schwannoma, neurofibroma)
3. Hemangioblastoma
4. Spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF)
5. Metastatic tumor with AV shunting

The presence of intratumoral vessels, bone remodeling, and AV shunting are more suggestive of a vascular lesion or a tumor with significant vascularity. The differential diagnosis would be narrowed down based on these specific imaging characteristics.

Confidence Level: 85%

Please note that the actual diagnosis would require a comprehensive review of the full clinical history, physical examination, and correlation with the complete set of imaging studies. The confidence levels provided are based on the limited information available and are intended to reflect the likelihood of the differential diagnosis being accurate in the context of typical cases with similar presentations.",85,Good

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the content at the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11182021/tab-legends), which describes a heterogeneous, predominantly T2-hypointense lesion with peripheral ring enhancement and no diffusion restriction, along with obstructive hydrocephalus and a large lipid peak on MR spectroscopy, the differential diagnosis can be refined:

1. High-grade glioma (e.g., glioblastoma multiforme) - typically shows ring enhancement and may have a lipid peak due to necrosis.
2. Anaplastic astrocytoma - similar to glioblastoma but less aggressive.
3. Central nervous system lymphoma - can present with ring-enhancing lesions, though more commonly homogeneously enhancing.
4. Infectious abscess - can show ring enhancement, but usually has diffusion restriction.
5. Demyelinating lesion - less likely given the ring enhancement and mass effect, but still possible.

The presence of a large lipid peak suggests necrosis, which is more commonly associated with high-grade tumors. The lack of diffusion restriction makes an abscess less likely. The mild enhancement in the interpeduncular cistern could suggest leptomeningeal spread, which is seen in malignancies and infections.

Confidence Level: 85%

The actual diagnosis would require further clinical correlation, potentially additional imaging (such as PET scan), and likely biopsy for histopathological confirmation.

2021,Giant Thrombosed Posterior Cerebral Artery Aneurysm,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06172021), we have a case of a 41-year-old man with a seizure. The clinical information is limited, but based on the common causes of seizures in adults, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Glioma (including astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma)
2. Metastatic brain lesion
3. Meningioma (less likely given the presentation)
4. Cerebral abscess
5. Vascular malformation (e.g., cavernoma, arteriovenous malformation)

Confidence Level: 60%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the content at the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06172021/tab-legends), which describes a low-density mass with peripheral calcification in the left medial temporal lobe, high intensity on T2WI and FLAIR, hypointense rim on T2WI and FLAIR, mild hyperintensity on T1WI, slight peripheral enhancement, and poor visualization of the left PCA on TOF-MRA and DSA, the differential diagnosis can be refined:

1. Low-grade glioma with calcification
2. Ganglioglioma
3. Oligodendroglioma
4. Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET)
5. Cavernous malformation with associated hemorrhage or calcification

The presence of calcification and the imaging characteristics suggest a more indolent process, which is more consistent with low-grade primary brain tumors or a vascular malformation. The lack of vascular flow inside the mass on DSA and the poor visualization of the left PCA could be due to mass effect or an associated vascular anomaly.

Confidence Level: 80%

The actual diagnosis would require further clinical correlation and likely biopsy for histopathological confirmation. The confidence levels provided are based on the imaging characteristics and the typical presentations of such lesions.",80,Insufficient
2021,Grisel Syndrome,"Based on the clinical presentation of an 11-year-old girl with a fixed torticollis and right hand weakness on a background of more than one month of neck pain and recurrent tonsillitis, as described in the content from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06102021), here are five initial differential diagnoses:

2. Cervical spine infection (e.g., osteomyelitis, discitis)
3. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis
4. Cervical spine tumor (e.g., bone tumor, spinal cord tumor)
5. Cervical spine trauma with associated injury

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the content at the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06102021/tab-legends), which describes asymmetric rotatory subluxation at the lateral atlantoaxial articulations, rupture of the transverse ligament, severe spinal canal narrowing, compression of the upper cervical cord, retropharyngeal effusion with edema, and marrow edema and enhancement within the odontoid process and body of C2 suggestive of osteomyelitis, the differential diagnosis can be refined:

1. Grisel's syndrome (non-traumatic atlantoaxial subluxation associated with infection)
2. Osteomyelitis of the cervical spine with secondary atlantoaxial subluxation
3. Septic arthritis of the atlantoaxial joint
4. Traumatic atlantoaxial subluxation with associated infection
5. Inflammatory conditions such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis with cervical spine involvement

The imaging findings and clinical history of recurrent tonsillitis suggest an infectious or inflammatory process leading to instability of the cervical spine. The presence of osteomyelitis and septic arthritis is particularly concerning given the enhancement and marrow edema.

Confidence Level: 90%

The actual diagnosis would require further clinical correlation, laboratory findings (e.g., inflammatory markers, blood cultures), and potentially biopsy or surgical intervention for definitive diagnosis and treatment. The confidence levels provided are based on the imaging characteristics and the typical presentations of such conditions.",90,Excellent
2021,Growing Skull Fracture,"Based on the clinical presentation of an 8-month-old infant with head trauma 2 months ago and recent left parietal progressive scalp swelling, as described in the content from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03252021), here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Post-traumatic leptomeningeal cyst (growing skull fracture)
2. Encephalocele
3. Osteomyelitis of the skull with associated subperiosteal abscess
4. Post-traumatic cephalohematoma with underlying skull fracture

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the content at the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03252021/tab-legends), which describes a left parietal bone defect of 3 cm with extension to the ipsilateral occipital bone, through which intracranial contents protrude, and a multicavitated area consistent with encephalomalacia that protrudes through the bone defect, the differential diagnosis can be refined:

1. Post-traumatic leptomeningeal cyst (growing skull fracture) - most likely given the history of trauma and the imaging findings of a bone defect with protrusion of intracranial contents.
2. Encephalocele - less likely given the history of trauma, but could present with similar imaging findings.
3. Cephalohematoma with secondary bone resorption - possible but less likely given the description of encephalomalacia.
4. Atrophic brain changes secondary to trauma with associated skull defect.
5. Post-traumatic brain herniation through a skull fracture.

The imaging findings and clinical history strongly suggest a growing skull fracture, also known as a leptomeningeal cyst, where the dura has been breached and brain tissue herniates through the bone defect.

Confidence Level: 95%

The actual diagnosis would likely be confirmed with clinical examination and the history of head trauma, along with the imaging findings. The confidence levels provided are based on the typical presentation of such conditions in the context of the patient's history and imaging characteristics.",95,Excellent
2021,Huntington Disease,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 26-year-old woman with abnormal involuntary jerky movements of the head and upper and lower limbs for 3 years and difficulty in walking for the same duration, as described in the content from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03042021), here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Huntington's disease
2. Wilson's disease

5. Neuroacanthocytosis

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the content at the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03042021/tab-legends), which describes atrophy of the caudate nucleus with a ""boxlike"" configuration of the frontal horns and blooming in bilateral globi pallidi and putamen on SWI, the differential diagnosis can be refined:

1. Huntington's disease - characterized by caudate atrophy and associated with choreiform movements.
2. Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) - may show blooming on SWI due to iron deposition.
3. Wilson's disease - can present with movement disorders and may show abnormal SWI signal in the basal ganglia.
4. Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome (a form of NBIA) - associated with iron deposition in the basal ganglia.
5. Carbon monoxide poisoning or hypoxic-ischemic injury - can lead to globus pallidus changes, but less likely given the chronic presentation.

The ""boxlike"" configuration of the frontal horns and the progression of caudate atrophy are particularly suggestive of Huntington's disease, which is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder. The presence of blooming in the globi pallidi and putamen could indicate additional iron deposition, which is seen in various neurodegenerative conditions, including NBIA and Wilson's disease.

Confidence Level: 90%

The actual diagnosis would require further clinical correlation, including genetic testing for Huntington's disease, serum ceruloplasmin levels for Wilson's disease, and possibly brain biopsy if NBIA is strongly suspected.

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the content at the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01282021/tab-legends), which describes left internal auditory canal (IAC) atresia with only a small cavity in the cochlear aperture and no discernible modiolus, and nerve fibers that emerge along with the trigeminal nerve but course laterally into a canal leading to the geniculate ganglion, the differential diagnosis can be refined:

1. Congenital IAC atresia - consistent with the imaging findings of a small cavity and absence of the modiolus.
2. Michel deformity - complete labyrinthine aplasia, but typically more severe than what is described.
3. Mondini dysplasia - incomplete partition of the cochlea, but usually with some cochlear development.
4. Congenital sensorineural hearing loss due to other inner ear malformations.
5. Congenital facial nerve anomaly - given the abnormal course of nerve fibers.

The imaging findings are highly suggestive of a congenital inner ear anomaly, specifically IAC atresia, which is associated with sensorineural hearing loss. The absence of the modiolus and the abnormal course of nerve fibers are indicative of a developmental abnormality.

Confidence Level: 95%

The actual diagnosis would likely be confirmed with a comprehensive clinical examination, including audiometric testing, and a detailed review of the high-resolution temporal bone imaging. The confidence levels provided are based on the imaging characteristics and the typical presentations of congenital inner ear anomalies.",95,Excellent
2021,Infantile Krabbe Disease (Globoid Cell Leukodystrophy),"Based on the clinical presentation of a 10-month-old with developmental delay, regression in the last 2 months, limb spasticity, and truncal hypotonia, as described in the content from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07012021), here are five initial differential diagnoses:

Confidence Level: 65%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the content at the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07012021/tab-legends), which describes increased signal in bilateral frontoparietal deep white matter with a ""tigroid"" appearance, low signal in the thalamus, especially ventrolaterally and in the pulvinars, an enlarged chiasm and cisternal optic nerves with increased signal in the splenium of the corpus callosum, and no enhancement in the region of deep white matter hyperintensities, but oculomotor, trigeminal, and vestibulocochlear nerve enhancement, the differential diagnosis can be refined:

1. Leukodystrophy (e.g., metachromatic leukodystrophy, Krabbe disease) - ""tigroid"" pattern is characteristic.
2. Mitochondrial disorder (e.g., Leigh syndrome) - may show thalamic involvement.
3. Lysosomal storage disease (e.g., Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease) - can present with optic nerve enlargement and white matter changes.
4. Inflammatory or autoimmune encephalitis (e.g., ADEM) - less likely given the absence of enhancement in white matter.
5. Congenital infection (e.g., congenital CMV) - may present with developmental delay and white matter changes, but less consistent with nerve enhancement.

The ""tigroid"" pattern of white matter changes is particularly suggestive of a leukodystrophy, which is a group of disorders characterized by abnormal development or destruction of the white matter of the brain.

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the content at the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05132021/tab-legends), which describes a heterogeneous, partially enhancing lesion surrounding the aorta with extension into the L1 and L2 vertebrae, associated osseous enhancement, anterior displacement of the aortic lumen with the lesion inseparable from the aortic wall, areas of avid vascular enhancement within the lesion, and vertebral scalloping, the differential diagnosis can be refined:

1. Aortitis with associated vertebral involvement - could be infectious or inflammatory in origin.
2. Infectious spondylodiscitis - considering the patient's immunocompromised status, an infectious etiology is possible.
3. Neoplastic infiltration - lymphoma or metastatic disease could present with these imaging findings.
4. Vascular tumor - such as a paraganglioma, given the vascular enhancement.
5. Retroperitoneal fibrosis - can cause ureteral and vascular encasement, but less commonly involves the vertebrae.

The presence of a lesion surrounding the aorta with avid vascular enhancement and extension into the vertebrae is concerning for a process that involves both the vascular and osseous structures. Given the patient's history of HIV and low CD4 counts, infectious and neoplastic etiologies should be strongly considered.

Confidence Level: 85%

The actual diagnosis would require further clinical correlation, including laboratory findings, potentially biopsy or surgical intervention for definitive diagnosis, and treatment. The confidence levels provided are based on the imaging characteristics and the typical presentations of such conditions in the context of the patient's immunocompromised status.",85,Good
2021,Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumor,"Based on the clinical history provided in the content from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08192021), a 24-year-old man with a history of traumatic injury to his back, lingering back pain, and recent onset of numbness progressing from the feet to the abdomen and hands, with a sensory level of T3, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

2. Spinal epidural hematoma
3. Spinal cord contusion or traumatic myelopathy
4. Spinal epidural abscess
5. Transverse myelitis

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the content at the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08192021/tab-legends), which describes enhancing peridural soft tissue at T3 that is hypointense on T2WI, spinal cord signal abnormality with adjacent intradural enhancement at T5, a right dorsolateral dural breach at T5, and intraoperative findings of abnormally thickened bone contiguous and inseparable from the dura, the differential diagnosis can be refined:

1. Spinal epidural abscess with osteomyelitis - given the enhancing peridural tissue and abnormal bone findings.
2. Spinal neoplasm with secondary bone involvement - such as a metastasis or primary bone tumor.
3. Spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (SDAVF) - could explain the dural enhancement and cord signal changes.
4. Traumatic dural tear with subsequent inflammatory changes - considering the history of trauma and dural breach.
5. Infectious or inflammatory spondylodiscitis - could lead to adjacent soft tissue and dural involvement.

The imaging findings of enhancing peridural tissue, spinal cord signal abnormality, and the dural breach, along with the intraoperative note of thickened bone contiguous with the dura, suggest a process that involves both the dura and adjacent bony structures. The history of trauma and the progression of symptoms are important clinical details that guide the differential diagnosis.

Confidence Level: 85%

2. Chronic subdural hematoma
3. Postoperative changes with possible residual hematoma
4. Temporal lobe cyst or porencephalic cyst
5. Glioma or other neoplastic process

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02252021/tab-legends), which describes an extra-axial round mass at the left temporal pole with specific imaging characteristics such as a hyperintense mass with a hypointense ring on T2-weighted MRI, restricted diffusion on DWI with low ADC values, and thick ring enhancement on postcontrast T1, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Chronic encapsulated subdural hematoma
2. Abscess with surrounding edema and possible capsule formation
3. Neoplastic lesion such as a meningioma with cystic or necrotic components
4. Metastasis with central necrosis or cystic degeneration
5. Atypical infectious process such as a fungal or tuberculous granuloma

Confidence Level: 85%

The presence of ring enhancement and restricted diffusion suggests a lesion with a more organized structure, possibly indicative of a chronic process or a lesion with a cellular or fibrous capsule. The specific imaging characteristics and the patient's clinical history are critical in narrowing down the differential diagnoses. Further clinical correlation, laboratory tests, and possibly biopsy or surgical intervention may be required for a definitive diagnosis.",85,Insufficient
2021,Intradural Extramedullary Tuberculoma of the Spinal Cord,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06242021), we have a case of a 24-year-old female refugee from Eritrea with weight loss and B symptoms. B symptoms typically refer to systemic symptoms of fever, night sweats, and weight loss, often associated with lymphoproliferative disorders.

Given this clinical context and without specific imaging details, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Lymphoma, particularly primary central nervous system lymphoma
2. Tuberculosis, considering the patient's demographic and systemic symptoms
3. Metastatic disease, with unknown primary cancer
4. Neurosarcoidosis, which can present with systemic symptoms and CNS involvement
5. Multiple sclerosis or other demyelinating disease, given the age and systemic symptoms

Confidence Level: 65%

After reviewing the additional details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06242021/tab-legends), which describes high intramedullary cord signal with abnormal contour of the dorsal cord, formation of low T2 signal intensity nodules that enhance on postgadolinium T1 sequences, and resolution of intradural extramedullary nodules after appropriate therapy, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Spinal cord abscess or granuloma, possibly due to tuberculosis or other infectious agents
2. Primary CNS lymphoma with spinal involvement
3. Neurosarcoidosis, which can present with granulomas and enhancement
4. Metastatic disease with spinal cord involvement
5. Inflammatory demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica, considering the changes after therapy

Confidence Level: 75%

The imaging findings of nodular enhancement and the response to therapy suggest an infectious or inflammatory process. The patient's background and systemic symptoms raise the index of suspicion for an infectious etiology such as tuberculosis, which can present with spinal involvement. However, lymphoma and other granulomatous diseases remain important considerations. Further diagnostic workup, including laboratory tests, CSF analysis, and possibly biopsy, would be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis.",75,Good
2021,Intradural Spinal Mature Teratoma,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03182021), we have a case of a 52-year-old woman with occipital headaches and left upper extremity pain, with a history of surgery at age 14 for a posterior neck mass.

Given this clinical context and without the specific imaging details, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Recurrence of the previously resected neck mass
2. Meningioma
3. Schwannoma or neurofibroma
4. Arachnoid cyst
5. Epidermoid cyst or dermoid cyst

Confidence Level: 60%

After reviewing the additional details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03182021/tab-legends), which describes a nonenhancing, intradural, midline spinal canal mass at C1-C2 with layering components of different signal intensities on T2WI and T1WI, a small posterior focus of high signal on T1 that nulls on fat-suppressed, contrast-enhanced T1 sequence, and a midline soft-tissue defect from prior surgery, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Arachnoid cyst
2. Epidermoid cyst or dermoid cyst
3. Meningocele or meningeal cyst
4. Residual or recurrent mass from previous surgery (depending on the initial pathology)
5. Lipoma or lipomatous malformation (given the fat signal that nulls on fat suppression)

Additionally, the imaging of the lumbar spine reveals a split cord with a duplicated dural sac, tethering of the spinal cord, an osseous midline spur, and a vertebral body nonsegmentation anomaly, which suggests a diagnosis of diastematomyelia.

Confidence Level: 80%

The presence of a split cord and associated anomalies such as a ""butterfly"" vertebra and an osseous midline spur are indicative of a complex congenital spinal anomaly, likely present since birth, which may have been related to the patient's initial surgery. The nonenhancing intradural mass could represent a meningeal cyst or a residual lesion from the previous surgery, and the specific imaging characteristics help to narrow down the differential diagnosis. Further clinical correlation and potentially additional imaging or surgical exploration may be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis.",80,Insufficient
2021,Late-Onset Pompe Disease,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08122021), we have a case of a 58-year-old woman admitted to the intensive care unit with acute respiratory failure of unknown cause.

Without specific imaging details, here are five initial differential diagnoses that could potentially explain acute respiratory failure and may have radiologic manifestations:

1. Pneumonia, including aspiration pneumonia, which could lead to acute respiratory failure.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can occur due to various underlying causes.
3. Pulmonary embolism, which can cause sudden respiratory compromise.
4. Neuromuscular disorders leading to respiratory muscle weakness.
5. Obstructive sleep apnea or other causes of upper airway obstruction.

Confidence Level: 50%

After reviewing the additional details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08122021/tab-legends), which describes diffuse low density of the tongue muscles on CT, corresponding with diffuse high signal on T1WI and T2WI MRI, and uniform suppression of the fatty signal on T2 STIR sequence, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Myopathies, including inflammatory myopathies or myopathies with fatty replacement.
2. Muscular dystrophies, which can present with progressive fatty infiltration of muscles.
3. Amyloidosis, which can lead to muscle infiltration and atrophy.
4. Lingual thyroid, although typically midline, it can cause diffuse enlargement of the tongue.
5. Sarcopenia or disuse atrophy, which can result from chronic illness and immobility.

Confidence Level: 70%

The imaging findings of diffuse fatty infiltration of the tongue muscles are suggestive of a chronic process leading to muscle atrophy and replacement by fat. This could be related to a neuromuscular disorder or a muscular dystrophy. The acute respiratory failure may be a result of compromised airway due to the involvement of the tongue and respiratory muscles. Further clinical correlation and possibly additional laboratory and genetic testing would be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis.",70,Insufficient
2021,Lemierre Syndrome,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07082021), we have a case of a 26-year-old woman with worsening right maxillary facial pain, swelling, fevers, and chest pain; she presented to the emergency department (ED) 1 day prior for a right upper lip abscess that was incised and drained.

Given this clinical context, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Bacterial infection with possible progression to cellulitis or abscess formation.
2. Osteomyelitis of the maxilla or mandible, which could present with similar symptoms.
3. Dental abscess with spread to adjacent facial spaces.
4. Sinusitis with complications, potentially leading to an abscess.
5. Angioedema or allergic reaction, although less likely given the presence of fever and abscess.

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07082021/tab-legends), which describes a filling defect in the right facial vein representing venous thrombosis, asymmetric swelling of soft tissues of the face from cellulitis, and a prior tract of recent abscess incision and drainage, as well as cavitary and noncavitary lung nodules representing septic pulmonary emboli, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Lemierre's syndrome, which is characterized by thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein and septic emboli, often secondary to oropharyngeal infection.
2. Septic thrombophlebitis of the facial vein with secondary septic pulmonary embolism.
3. Infective endocarditis with septic emboli, although facial vein involvement would be atypical.
4. Necrotizing fasciitis, which can cause severe soft tissue infection and systemic symptoms.
5. Complicated sinusitis with thrombosis and septic embolism.

Confidence Level: 90%

The presence of venous thrombosis in the facial vein, history of an abscess, and septic pulmonary emboli are highly suggestive of a septic thrombophlebitis, possibly Lemierre's syndrome, which is a serious condition that can occur after oropharyngeal infections. The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with this diagnosis, and it should be considered a medical emergency requiring prompt treatment.",90,Excellent
2021,Meningeal Melanocytosis,"Based on the clinical history provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02112021), a 16-year-old boy presents with a 3-month history of headaches and vomiting, without fever, mild leukocytosis, normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) indices except for low glucose. Here are five initial differential diagnoses based on this clinical presentation:

1. Meningitis - The presence of headaches, vomiting, and CSF abnormalities could suggest an infectious process such as meningitis, although the absence of fever is less typical.
2. Intracranial mass - A brain tumor could present with headaches and vomiting due to increased intracranial pressure.
3. Subarachnoid hemorrhage - Headaches and vomiting are common symptoms, although typically there would be an acute onset and possibly signs of blood on imaging.
4. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) - Also known as pseudotumor cerebri, can present with headaches and vomiting, and sometimes with mild ventricular enlargement.
5. Encephalitis - Inflammation of the brain, which can present with headaches, vomiting, and altered mental status.

After reviewing the diagram description from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02112021/tab-legends), which mentions intrinsic T1 hyperintensity along the sulci of the right frontal lobe, diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement, and mild ventricular enlargement, the differential diagnosis can be refined:

1. Meningitis - The leptomeningeal enhancement is highly suggestive of an infectious or inflammatory process affecting the meninges.
2. Carcinomatous meningitis - Malignant cells in the CSF can cause leptomeningeal enhancement, although this is less common in a previously healthy teenager.
3. Sarcoidosis - Can cause leptomeningeal enhancement and may present with non-specific symptoms.
4. Autoimmune encephalitis - Such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, which can present with leptomeningeal enhancement and may have normal CSF indices.
5. Tuberculous meningitis - Can present with leptomeningeal enhancement and low CSF glucose, although it typically also presents with fever.

Given the imaging findings of leptomeningeal enhancement and the clinical presentation, I would assign a confidence level of 80% to the revised differential diagnoses. This confidence level reflects the consideration of both clinical and imaging findings, but definitive diagnosis would require further investigation, including CSF analysis, additional imaging, and potentially biopsy or other laboratory tests.",80,Insufficient
2021,Mitochondrial Disease with Heterozygous NUBPL Mutation,"Based on the provided content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05062021, the case describes a 50-year-old woman with a history of learning difficulties, behavioral changes, acute left hemiparesis, ataxia, progressive cognitive decline, motor impairment, and epileptic seizures. The family history is noted as irrelevant.

Given this clinical presentation, five initial differential diagnoses could include:

1. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) - A demyelinating disease that can present with cognitive decline, motor impairment, and seizures.
2. Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) - A rare brain infection that can cause white matter changes and neurological deficits.
3. Cerebral Autosomal-Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) - A genetic disorder leading to stroke and dementia.
4. Binswanger's Disease (Subcortical Arteriosclerotic Encephalopathy) - A form of small vessel vascular dementia.
5. Mitochondrial Disorders - These can present with a variety of neurological symptoms and may show white matter changes on imaging.

After reviewing the additional information from the diagram description provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05062021/tab-legends, which includes MRI findings of diffuse/confluent periventricular and subcortical white matter hyperintensity, sparing the U-fibers initially but involving them in a 7-year follow-up, with marked global parenchymal atrophy and no infratentorial signal abnormalities, the differential diagnoses may be revised as follows:

1. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) - The MRI findings are suggestive but not entirely typical for MS, as there is no mention of dissemination in time or space or gadolinium-enhancing lesions.
2. Leukodystrophies - A group of disorders characterized by progressive white matter degeneration, which may present with extensive white matter changes and cognitive decline.
3. Chronic Small Vessel Ischemic Disease - This can lead to progressive white matter hyperintensities and cognitive impairment.
4. Frontotemporal Dementia - A neurodegenerative condition that can present with behavioral changes and atrophy, though white matter changes are less common.
5. Adult-onset Leukoencephalopathy with Axonal Spheroids and Pigmented Glia (ALSP) - A rare disorder that can present with white matter changes and cognitive/behavioral symptoms.

Given the complexity of the case and the need for a comprehensive evaluation that includes clinical history, imaging findings, and possibly further testing such as genetic analysis or biopsy, the confidence level in providing a definitive diagnosis based solely on the provided information is moderate to low. Therefore, I would assign a confidence level of 60% to the revised differential diagnoses, with the understanding that further clinical correlation and diagnostic workup are necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis.",85,Good
2021,Mixed Hearing Loss due to Aberrant Position of the Right Facial Nerve,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04292021, the case involves a 16-year-old girl with mixed conductive/sensorineural hearing loss of the right ear and ""bumps"" in the left ear canal. Without specific imaging findings or additional clinical details, we can propose an initial list of differential diagnoses that could potentially explain these symptoms:

1. Cholesteatoma - An abnormal skin growth in the middle ear behind the eardrum that can cause hearing loss.
2. Otitis Media with Effusion - Fluid accumulation in the middle ear, which can lead to conductive hearing loss.
3. Otosclerosis - An abnormal bone growth in the middle ear that can cause conductive hearing loss.
4. External Auditory Canal Exostoses - Benign bony growths in the ear canal (""bumps"") that can be associated with conductive hearing loss if they obstruct the canal.
5. Congenital Malformations - Various congenital anomalies can present with conductive and sensorineural hearing loss.

After reviewing the additional information from the diagram description provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04292021/tab-legends, which includes CT findings showing poor development of the geniculate fossa, an aberrant course of the facial nerve through the otic capsule, and the facial nerve coursing within the oval window, the differential diagnoses may be revised as follows:

1. Congenital Facial Nerve Anomaly - The described CT findings suggest a developmental anomaly of the facial nerve.
2. Middle Ear Anomaly - The aberrant position of the tympanic segment of the facial nerve and its relationship with the stapes and oval window could be part of a broader middle ear developmental anomaly.
3. Superior Semicircular Canal Dehiscence - Although not directly described, any bony defect in the otic capsule could raise suspicion for this condition.
4. Temporal Bone Fracture - Unlikely given the patient's age and lack of trauma history, but aberrant facial nerve courses can be seen post-trauma.
5. Fibrous Dysplasia - A bone disorder that can cause abnormal growths or swellings in the ear canal, although it would not typically explain the facial nerve anomalies.

Given the specific imaging findings that point towards a congenital anomaly of the facial nerve and possibly the middle ear structures, the confidence level in the revised differential diagnosis is higher. I would assign a confidence level of 80% to the revised differential diagnoses, with the understanding that further clinical correlation, audiometric testing, and possibly genetic consultation are necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis.",80,Good
2021,Multinodular and Vacuolating Posterior Fossa Lesions of Unknown Significance (MV-PLUS),"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04222021, we have a 26-year-old man with a history of one episode of loss of awareness of surroundings.

1. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) - The presence of cortical and juxtacortical lesions with T2 prolongation could be consistent with MS, although the lack of enhancement and no change over two years is atypical.
2. Neurosarcoidosis - Can present with non-enhancing lesions, but systemic symptoms and other organ involvement are common.
3. Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) - A demyelinating disease caused by the JC virus, typically in immunocompromised individuals.
4. Gliosis/Scarring - Due to previous insult or injury, although typically there would be a history or evidence of such an event.
5. Low-Grade Glioma - A slow-growing brain tumor that might not show contrast enhancement or significant change over a short period.

Given the lack of enhancement and stability over two years, the likelihood of an aggressive process is lower. The confidence level in the revised differential diagnosis, considering the imaging findings and clinical history, is moderate. I would assign a confidence level of 70% to the revised differential diagnoses, with the understanding that further clinical correlation, follow-up imaging, and possibly additional diagnostic tests such as cerebrospinal fluid analysis or biopsy may be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis.",70,Insufficient

1. Acute Necrotizing Encephalopathy (ANE) - The involvement of the diencephalon and the imaging characteristics could suggest ANE, which is often associated with viral infections.
2. Limbic Encephalitis - An autoimmune or paraneoplastic syndrome that can cause inflammation of the limbic system, though typically with more focal involvement.
3. Hashimoto's Encephalopathy - A rare condition associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis that can cause diffuse brain involvement and encephalopathy.

2021,Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma of Nasal Cavity and Paranasal Sinuses _ Natural Killer Cell Type,"Based on the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07292021, we have a 31-year-old woman with an invasive facial lesion. Without specific clinical details such as the duration, growth rate of the lesion, or associated symptoms, here are five initial differential diagnoses for an invasive facial lesion:

1. Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) - A common type of skin cancer that can be locally invasive and affect the facial structures.
2. Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) - Another type of skin cancer that can invade local structures but is less likely to metastasize.
3. Malignant Melanoma - A type of skin cancer known for its aggressive behavior and potential for local invasion.
4. Sarcoma - A group of cancers that can arise from various tissue types and may present as an invasive mass in the facial region.
5. Invasive Fungal Infection - Such as mucormycosis, which can be aggressive and invade the orbit and sinuses, especially in immunocompromised individuals.

After reviewing the additional information from the diagram description provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07292021/tab-legends, which includes MRI findings of an irregular mass centered in the right lamina papyracea with extension to the ipsilateral orbit, soft palate, frontal sinus, upper lip, and pharynx, and true diffusion restriction on DWI and ADC map, the differential diagnoses may be revised as follows:

1. Invasive Sinonasal Carcinoma - Given the extensive involvement of the sinonasal structures and orbit.
2. Esthesioneuroblastoma - A rare cancer that originates in the olfactory epithelium and can show aggressive local invasion.
3. Lymphoma - Can present as a mass with invasion into adjacent structures, although it typically has a different imaging appearance.
4. Invasive Fungal Infection - Such as mucormycosis or aspergillosis, which can cause extensive local destruction and have a propensity for vascular invasion.
5. Sarcoma - Including osteosarcoma or chondrosarcoma, given the bone involvement and aggressive nature of the lesion.

Given the imaging characteristics and the aggressive nature of the lesion with multi-compartmental invasion, the confidence level in the revised differential diagnosis is moderate to high. I would assign a confidence level of 80% to the revised differential diagnoses, with the understanding that histopathological examination is essential for a definitive diagnosis and that further clinical correlation and laboratory testing may be necessary.",80,Good
2021,Nonketotic Hyperglycemic Hemichorea (NHH),"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11042021, a 70-year-old man with type 2 diabetes and hypertension presents with a 12-day history of abnormal involuntary left arm movements that disappeared during sleep, and 3 days of similar symptoms in the left leg. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for this case:

1. Hemiballismus-Hemichorea - Often associated with lesions in the contralateral subthalamic nucleus or basal ganglia, potentially due to vascular or metabolic causes.
2. Diabetic Striatopathy - A rare complication of uncontrolled diabetes that can cause hyperglycemia-induced hemichorea-hemiballismus.
3. Lacunar Stroke - Small vessel disease leading to a stroke in the deep structures of the brain, such as the basal ganglia, can present with movement disorders.

5. Infection or Abscess - In the basal ganglia region, which can cause movement disorders and may be associated with fever or other systemic symptoms.

After reviewing the additional information from the diagram description provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11042021/tab-legends, which includes imaging findings of focal uniform hyperdensity in the right putamen on NCCT, hypointensities in the right basal ganglia on FLAIR, and intrinsic T1 hyperintensity in the right putamen nuclei with no abnormality on DWI, the differential diagnoses may be revised as follows:

1. Diabetic Striatopathy - The imaging findings are consistent with this condition, which is associated with hyperglycemia and typically presents with hemichorea-hemiballismus.
2. Nonketotic Hyperglycemia - Similar to diabetic striatopathy, it can cause characteristic imaging findings in the basal ganglia due to metabolic disturbances.
3. Vascular Lesion - Such as a small hemorrhage or ischemic stroke affecting the basal ganglia, although the lack of DWI changes makes acute ischemia less likely.
4. Neurodegenerative Disorder - A possibility, but less likely given the acute presentation and specific imaging findings.
5. Inflammatory or Autoimmune Disorder - Such as vasculitis affecting the basal ganglia, though this is less consistent with the imaging findings.

Given the clinical history of poorly controlled diabetes and the characteristic imaging findings, the confidence level in the revised differential diagnosis, particularly diabetic striatopathy or nonketotic hyperglycemia, is high. I would assign a confidence level of 90% to the revised differential diagnoses, with the understanding that clinical correlation and laboratory findings, including glucose and HbA1c levels, are critical for confirming the diagnosis.",90,Excellent
2021,Orbital Hydatid Cyst,"Based on the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01212021, we have a 27-year-old woman with gradual-onset proptosis of the right eye and decreased vision for the last 4 months. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for this case:

2. Optic Nerve Glioma - Can cause proptosis and vision loss, especially if it extends to the retro-orbital space.
3. Thyroid Eye Disease (Graves' Ophthalmopathy) - Often presents with proptosis, but usually with more inflammatory signs and is often bilateral.
4. Orbital Pseudotumor (Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation) - Can cause proptosis and vision changes, typically with pain and signs of inflammation.
5. Cavernous Hemangioma - A benign vascular lesion that can present with proptosis and is the most common benign orbital tumor in adults.

After reviewing the additional information from the diagram description provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01212021/tab-legends, which includes MRI findings of a well-defined retro-orbital intraconal mass lesion with high signal on T2-weighted images, low signal on FLAIR and T1-weighted fat-suppressed precontrast images, a thin T2-weighted hypointense capsule, minimal rim enhancement on T1-weighted fat-suppressed postcontrast image, and no diffusion restriction, the differential diagnoses may be revised as follows:

1. Cavernous Hemangioma - The imaging characteristics described are highly suggestive of this benign vascular lesion.
2. Schwannoma - A nerve sheath tumor that can present with similar imaging features, including a well-defined capsule and enhancement.
3. Lymphangioma - A benign lesion that can present with similar MRI characteristics, although it may have more heterogeneous signal intensity due to the presence of fluid-fluid levels.
4. Optic Nerve Sheath Meningioma - Although typically causing more diffuse thickening of the optic nerve sheath, it can present with a well-defined lesion and enhancement.
5. Hemangiopericytoma - A rare vascular tumor that can present with similar imaging features, but is typically more aggressive and may show more prominent enhancement.

Given the imaging characteristics described, particularly the high signal on T2-weighted images, low signal on FLAIR and T1, the presence of a capsule, and minimal enhancement, the confidence level in the diagnosis of a cavernous hemangioma is high. I would assign a confidence level of 90% to the revised differential diagnosis, with the understanding that the final diagnosis would be confirmed by histopathological examination after surgical excision or biopsy.",90,Insufficient
2021,Pantothenate Kinase-Associated Neurodegeneration (PKAN),"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03112021, we have a 4-year-old boy with left arm posturing and delayed motor and speech milestones. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for this case:

1. Cerebral Palsy - A group of disorders that affect movement and muscle tone or posture, often due to early life brain damage.
2. Pediatric Stroke - Can lead to hemiparesis and developmental delays, depending on the area and extent of the brain affected.
3. Brain Malformation - Such as congenital anomalies of cortical development, which can present with motor delays and abnormal posturing.
4. Genetic/Metabolic Disorders - Conditions like mitochondrial diseases or metabolic storage diseases can present with developmental delays and neurological symptoms.
5. Infection/Inflammatory Conditions - Such as encephalitis or autoimmune encephalopathy, which can cause neurological deficits and developmental delays.

After reviewing the additional information from the diagram description provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03112021/tab-legends, which includes MRI findings of bilateral areas of high T2/FLAIR and corresponding low signal on T1WI in the central globi pallidi, cystic vacuolation, a subtle area of linear high signal giving the classic ""eye of the tiger"" sign, and marked hypointensity on T2 and T2*WI reflecting iron deposition, the differential diagnoses may be revised as follows:

1. Pantothenate Kinase-Associated Neurodegeneration (PKAN) - The ""eye of the tiger"" sign is a classic MRI finding for PKAN, a type of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA).
2. Other Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation (NBIA) Disorders - There are other forms of NBIA, but PKAN is the most associated with the ""eye of the tiger"" sign.
3. Wilson's Disease - A disorder of copper metabolism that can lead to neurological symptoms and may show brain MRI abnormalities, though typically not the ""eye of the tiger"" sign.
4. Hallervorden-Spatz Syndrome - An older term previously used for PKAN before the genetic basis was understood.
5. Carbon Monoxide Poisoning - Can lead to bilateral globus pallidus lesions, but the clinical history and ""eye of the tiger"" sign are not typical.

Given the presence of the ""eye of the tiger"" sign, which is highly specific for PKAN, the confidence level in the diagnosis of PKAN is very high. I would assign a confidence level of 95% to the revised differential diagnosis, with the understanding that genetic testing is typically used to confirm the diagnosis of PKAN.",95,Excellent

1. Ganglioglioma - A rare tumor that can present with a glioneural pattern and may show cystic and solid components, as well as enhancement.
2. Pilocytic Astrocytoma - A glial tumor that can have a cystic component with an enhancing mural nodule, although it is more common in children.
3. Anaplastic Astrocytoma - A higher-grade glioma that can present with a complex mass and surrounding edema, but the histopathology would typically be different.
4. Pleomorphic Xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) - A rare CNS tumor that can present with leptomeningeal involvement and a cystic appearance with an enhancing mural nodule.
5. Meningioma - While the histopathology is not typical for meningioma, it can present with similar imaging features and involve the dura.

Given the specific histopathological findings described, which suggest a glioneural tumor with a papillary pattern and strong GFAP and synaptophysin localization, the confidence level in the diagnosis of a ganglioglioma or a similar glioneural tumor is high. I would assign a confidence level of 85% to the revised differential diagnosis, with the understanding that the final diagnosis would be confirmed by the complete histopathological examination and potentially additional immunohistochemical staining.",85,Insufficient

1. Germinoma - Given the high cellularity indicated by restricted diffusion and the location in the pineal region.
2. Pineal Parenchymal Tumor - Such as pineoblastoma, which can present with a high-cellularity mass and heterogeneous enhancement.
3. Lymphoma - Primary CNS lymphoma can present with similar imaging features and is known for its high cellularity and enhancement.
4. Metastasis - The presence of a high-cellularity lesion with heterogeneous enhancement could be consistent with a metastatic deposit.
5. Glioma - Specifically a high-grade glioma, given the extension into the midbrain and thalami, and the presence of cystic areas.

Given the imaging characteristics and the location of the lesion, the confidence level in the revised differential diagnosis is moderate.

After reviewing the additional information from the diagram description provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10212021/tab-legends, which includes imaging findings of a solid cystic mass in the suprasellar region with obstructive hydrocephalus, inferior displacement of the optic chiasm, mass effect upon the third ventricle with leftward displacement, no diffusion restriction, and microscopic features showing small bipolar nuclei and blue-gray myxoid matrix, the differential diagnoses may be revised as follows:

1. Craniopharyngioma - The imaging and microscopic features are highly suggestive of this diagnosis, particularly the presence of a myxoid matrix.
2. Pilocytic Astrocytoma - A tumor that can present with a cystic and solid appearance and may have a myxoid matrix, although it is more common in the cerebellum or brainstem.
3. Germinoma - A type of germ cell tumor that can occur in the suprasellar region, but the microscopic features are not typical.

2021,Polyarteritis Nodosa,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08262021, a 31-year-old man with a history of ileo-ileal resection and anastomosis presents with altered sensorium and vomiting for 2 days. The imaging findings include multifocal hypointense areas in the periphery of the brain on SWI, acute infarct in the left cerebellar hemisphere and brainstem on DWI, multiple aneurysms in cortical branches of bilateral middle cerebral arteries and irregularity of the right MCA on CTA, occlusion of the distal half of the basilar artery and a beaded appearance of bilateral posterior cerebral arteries on CTA, and gas lucency surrounding cardiac borders on chest radiograph with air dissecting through airways into the mediastinum on CT chest.

Here are five initial differential diagnoses for this case:

1. Infective Endocarditis - Can lead to septic emboli causing multifocal infarcts and mycotic aneurysms, with possible secondary pneumomediastinum from septic lung infarcts.
2. Vasculitis - Such as CNS vasculitis, which can cause multifocal infarcts and vessel irregularities.
3. Moya Moya Disease - A condition characterized by stenosis of the intracranial arteries that can lead to the development of collateral vessels and aneurysms.
4. Fibromuscular Dysplasia - A non-atherosclerotic, non-inflammatory disease of the blood vessels that can cause aneurysms and dissections.

After reviewing the additional information from the diagram description provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08262021/tab-legends, which includes the presence of multiple aneurysms, vessel occlusions, and air dissecting into the mediastinum, the differential diagnoses may be revised as follows:

1. Infective Endocarditis - The presence of multiple aneurysms, infarcts, and pneumomediastinum could be due to septic emboli from infective endocarditis.
2. Vascular Infection with Septic Emboli - Similar to infective endocarditis, other vascular infections could lead to aneurysms and infarcts.
3. Traumatic or Iatrogenic Vascular Injury - The history of surgery raises the possibility of iatrogenic causes for the vascular abnormalities.
4. Gas-Forming Organism Infection - The presence of gas in the mediastinum could suggest an infection with a gas-forming organism.
5. Boerhaave Syndrome - Spontaneous esophageal rupture could explain the pneumomediastinum, but it does not account for the cerebral findings unless secondary infection has occurred.

Given the combination of neurovascular and thoracic findings, particularly the presence of multiple aneurysms, vessel occlusions, and pneumomediastinum, the confidence level in the diagnosis of an infectious etiology such as infective endocarditis is high. I would assign a confidence level of 85% to the revised differential diagnosis, with the understanding that further clinical correlation, laboratory testing, and possibly additional imaging or invasive procedures may be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis.",85,Insufficient

2. Encephalitis - An infection or inflammation of the brain, which could be related to a recent systemic infection such as typhoid.
3. Hypertensive Encephalopathy - Severe hypertension can lead to a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and result in cerebral edema and altered mental status.
4. Intracranial Hemorrhage - Hypertension is a risk factor for hemorrhagic stroke, which can present with a sudden decrease in consciousness.
5. Metabolic Encephalopathy - Various metabolic disturbances can lead to altered mental status and may show changes on MRI.

After reviewing the additional information from the diagram description provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06032021/tab-legends, which includes MRI findings of bilateral symmetric hypointensity in the caudate nuclei, thalami, putamen, globi pallidi, external capsule, and insular cortex on T1WI, the ""trident sign"" in the lower pons on T1WI, hyperintense signal on T2-FLAIR in the corresponding areas, hyperintensity in the periventricular white matter, restricted diffusion on DWI, and no significant enhancement on postcontrast MPRAGE, the differential diagnoses may be revised as follows:

1. Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) - The presence of bilateral symmetric lesions and the recent history of infection could suggest a post-infectious inflammatory process.
2. Central Pontine Myelinolysis (CPM) - The ""trident sign"" is characteristic of CPM, which can be associated with rapid correction of hyponatremia.
3. Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy - The symmetric nature of the lesions could be due to a global hypoxic or ischemic event.
4. Mitochondrial Encephalopathy - Such as Leigh syndrome, which can present with bilateral symmetric lesions in the basal ganglia and thalami.
5. Osmotic Demyelination Syndrome (ODS) - Similar to CPM, ODS can occur with rapid shifts in osmolality and can affect the pons and extrapontine regions.

Given the specific imaging findings, particularly the ""trident sign"" and the bilateral symmetric involvement of the basal ganglia and thalami, the confidence level in the diagnosis of a demyelinating process such as Central Pontine Myelinolysis or Osmotic Demyelination Syndrome is high. I would assign a confidence level of 90% to the revised differential diagnosis, with the understanding that clinical correlation and laboratory findings, including electrolyte levels, are critical for confirming the diagnosis.",90,Excellent
2021,Posttraumatic Sialocele of the Submandibular Gland,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09162021, a 25-year-old man sustained a gunshot wound to the face. The imaging findings include a well-marginated, thin-walled cyst in the right submandibular space with foci of shrapnel along its margins, a right parasymphyseal mandibular fracture, and the presence of air, shrapnel, and effacement of soft tissue planes along the right floor of the mouth, submandibular space, and right lateral neck soft tissues from the initial injury.

Here are five initial differential diagnoses for this case:

1. Post-traumatic cyst or pseudocyst - Formation due to injury and associated with hemorrhage, inflammation, or infection.
2. Abscess formation - Secondary infection following the gunshot wound could lead to an abscess in the submandibular space.
3. Salivary gland injury - Direct trauma to the submandibular gland could result in ductal disruption and cyst formation.
4. Hematoma - A collection of blood that may organize and encapsulate over time, potentially mimicking a cystic lesion.
5. Foreign body granuloma - A reaction to shrapnel or other foreign material introduced during the injury.

After reviewing the additional information from the diagram description provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09162021/tab-legends, which describes the cystic structure's relationship with the submandibular gland and the trajectory of the bullet extending across the submandibular gland, the differential diagnoses may be revised as follows:

1. Post-traumatic salivary gland cyst (sialocele) - The cystic structure's location and the history of trauma suggest a sialocele, which is a collection of saliva that has leaked from a damaged gland or duct.
2. Organizing hematoma - The cyst could represent an organizing hematoma that has developed a well-defined wall over time.
3. Abscess - Although the well-marginated nature of the cyst is less typical for an abscess, it cannot be completely ruled out without clinical correlation.
4. Foreign body granuloma - The presence of shrapnel near the cyst suggests the possibility of a granulomatous reaction to foreign material.
5. Lymphocele - A collection of lymphatic fluid that may form following trauma or surgery, although less likely given the location and history.

Given the history of a gunshot wound, the location of the cyst, and the imaging findings suggesting a relationship with the submandibular gland, the confidence level in the diagnosis of a post-traumatic salivary gland cyst (sialocele) is high. I would assign a confidence level of 95% to the revised differential diagnosis, with the understanding that clinical examination and possibly further diagnostic tests, such as sialography or fine-needle aspiration, may be used to confirm the diagnosis.",95,Excellent
2021,Renal Osteodystrophy with Brown Tumors,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12022021, a 67-year-old woman with a history of dementia and end-stage renal disease presents to the emergency department after a fall. The imaging findings include numerous lucent and mixed-density lesions throughout the calvarium, thickening of primary trabeculae and resorption of secondary trabeculae in the lumbar spine, along with sclerotic bands along the endplates, and well-circumscribed mostly hyperintense lesions on fat-saturated FLAIR MRI. The lesions have progressed compared with a head CT from 2013.

Here are five initial differential diagnoses for this case:

1. Metastatic Disease - Multiple lesions in the calvarium could represent metastases from a primary cancer elsewhere in the body.
2. Multiple Myeloma - This condition can cause lytic bone lesions, which may appear as lucent areas on CT.
3. Osteolytic Bone Disease - Such as hyperparathyroidism, which can cause resorption of bone and may be related to end-stage renal disease.
4. Paget's Disease of Bone - Characterized by abnormal bone remodeling, which can lead to thickened trabeculae and mixed-density lesions.
5. Fibrous Dysplasia - A benign bone disorder that can cause mixed-density lesions and may affect the calvarium and spine.

After reviewing the additional information from the diagram description provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12022021/tab-legends, which describes the CT and MRI findings in more detail, the differential diagnoses may be revised as follows:

1. Metastatic Disease - The progression of lesions over time and their appearance on imaging could still be consistent with metastases.
2. Multiple Myeloma - The presence of numerous lucent lesions and the patient's age make this a strong consideration.
3. Brown Tumors of Hyperparathyroidism - These are osteolytic lesions that occur in the setting of hyperparathyroidism, which can be secondary to chronic renal failure.
4. Paget's Disease of Bone - The thickening of trabeculae and sclerotic bands could be seen in Paget's disease, although the well-circumscribed nature of the MRI lesions may be less typical.
5. Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) - Can cause lytic bone lesions and be progressive, but is less common in this age group.

Given the patient's history of end-stage renal disease and the specific pattern of bone changes, the confidence level in the diagnosis of a metabolic bone disease such as Brown Tumors of Hyperparathyroidism is moderate to high. I would assign a confidence level of 80% to the revised differential diagnosis, with the understanding that further clinical correlation, laboratory testing (including parathyroid hormone levels), and possibly a biopsy may be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis.",80,Excellent
2021,Sarcoid Meningoencephalitis,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07152021, a 41-year-old woman presents with acute confusional syndrome and no significant medical history. The MRI images demonstrate cortical/subcortical signal intensity alterations with high signal on T2 and FLAIR, and diffuse leptomeningeal thickening and micronodular enhancement on postgadolinium T1-weighted gradient-echo and spin-echo imaging.

Here are five initial differential diagnoses for this case:

1. Meningitis - Infection of the leptomeninges, which can cause diffuse thickening and enhancement.
2. Carcinomatous Meningitis - Malignant cells in the CSF and leptomeninges, often secondary to a known or occult primary tumor.
3. Neurosarcoidosis - A systemic inflammatory disease that can affect the CNS and cause leptomeningeal enhancement.
4. Autoimmune Encephalitis - Such as limbic encephalitis, which can present with confusion and may show leptomeningeal enhancement.
5. Cerebral Vasculitis - Inflammation of the cerebral vessels, which can cause cortical and subcortical signal changes and leptomeningeal enhancement.

After reviewing the additional information from the diagram description provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07152021/tab-legends, which includes the presence of cortical/subcortical signal intensity alterations and diffuse leptomeningeal thickening and micronodular enhancement, the differential diagnoses may be revised as follows:

1. Infectious Meningitis - The presence of leptomeningeal enhancement could indicate an infectious process, particularly if associated with fever or other systemic signs.
2. Carcinomatous Meningitis - The micronodular enhancement pattern could be consistent with metastatic disease involving the meninges.
3. Neurosarcoidosis - Can present with similar imaging findings, but other systemic manifestations of sarcoidosis would support this diagnosis.
4. Autoimmune Encephalitis - The acute confusional state and MRI findings could be consistent with an autoimmune process.
5. Cerebral Vasculitis - The signal intensity alterations could be due to inflammation of the cerebral vessels, although this is less common.

Given the imaging findings of leptomeningeal enhancement and the clinical presentation of acute confusional syndrome, the confidence level in the diagnosis of a meningitis (infectious or carcinomatous) or an inflammatory/autoimmune process is moderate. I would assign a confidence level of 70% to the revised differential diagnoses, with the understanding that further clinical correlation, CSF analysis, and possibly additional laboratory and imaging studies are necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis.",70,Excellent
2021,Spinal Epidermoid Cyst Post_Myelomeningocele Repair,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04012021, we have a 2-year-old boy with a prenatal diagnosis and fetal surgery of myelomeningocele and Chiari type 2 malformation, who is undergoing control evaluation imaging without symptoms. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for an intradural, extramedullary lesion in the context of postoperative changes from myelomeningocele repair:

1. Arachnoid cyst - A benign cystic lesion that can be associated with developmental anomalies and may appear in the intradural extramedullary space.
2. Meningocele - A postoperative meningocele could present as a cystic lesion, although it would typically be isointense to CSF on all sequences.
3. Epidermoid cyst - A benign lesion that can arise from entrapped ectodermal tissue during neural tube closure or surgery.
4. Dermoid cyst - Similar to an epidermoid cyst but may contain fat or other tissue elements.
5. Scar tissue or granulation tissue - Postoperative changes can sometimes form mass-like lesions that may enhance and show restricted diffusion.

After reviewing the additional information from the diagram description provided at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04012021/tab-legends, which includes MRI findings of a well-circumscribed intradural, extramedullary lesion that is slightly hyperintense to CSF on T1WI with thin peripheral rim enhancement, mildly hypointense to CSF on T2WI, and shows hyperintensity in DWI with corresponding low intensity in ADC map indicating diffusion restriction, the differential diagnoses may be revised as follows:

1. Epidermoid cyst - The diffusion restriction is characteristic of epidermoid cysts, which are commonly hyperintense on DWI and hypointense on ADC.
2. Arachnoid cyst - Less likely given the diffusion restriction, but still a consideration.
3. Postoperative scar or granulation tissue - Could potentially show enhancement and restricted diffusion, but usually does not form a well-circumscribed lesion.
4. Abscess - An intradural abscess could show rim enhancement and diffusion restriction, although clinical signs of infection are typically present.
5. Neoplasm - A low-grade tumor such as a pilocytic astrocytoma could present in this fashion, but would be less common in this location and clinical context.

Given the imaging characteristics, particularly the diffusion restriction, the confidence level in the diagnosis of an epidermoid cyst is high. I would assign a confidence level of 90% to the revised differential diagnosis, with the understanding that the final diagnosis would be confirmed by histopathological examination after surgical excision or biopsy.",90,Excellent
2021,Sturge-Weber Syndrome,"Based on the initial content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12232021, a 45-year-old man presented with neck pain. However, the specific details regarding imaging findings or clinical history that could guide the differential diagnosis were not included in the content summary. Therefore, without additional clinical or imaging information, it is challenging to provide an accurate list of differential diagnoses. Nonetheless, common causes of neck pain that might be considered include:

1. Cervical spondylosis
2. Cervical disc herniation
3. Cervical stenosis
4. Muscle strain
5. Inflammatory or infectious causes (e.g., meningitis, vertebral osteomyelitis)

Confidence Level: 50% (This confidence level reflects the uncertainty due to the lack of specific clinical or imaging details in the provided content.)

After reviewing the additional content from the diagram description at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12232021/tab-legends, the imaging findings include lateral cervical spine x-ray showing gyriform calcifications of the subcortical white matter that project over the calvarium, and axial and coronal head CT scans showing subcortical gyriform calcifications of the white matter of the right frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes with associated asymmetric atrophy/encephalomalacia, consistent with Sturge-Weber syndrome, and ipsilateral choroid plexus enlargement.

Given this specific information, the differential diagnosis should be revised to consider conditions associated with these neuroradiological findings:

1. Sturge-Weber syndrome (confirmed by the provided description)
2. Other neurocutaneous syndromes (e.g., tuberous sclerosis)
3. Cerebral dysgenesis
4. Post-infectious or post-inflammatory sequelae leading to encephalomalacia and calcifications
5. Idiopathic intracranial calcifications

Confidence Level: 95% (This confidence level is high due to the specific imaging findings described, which are characteristic of Sturge-Weber syndrome, and the confirmation provided in the content summary.)",95,Excellent
2021,Traumatic Carotid Cavernous Fistula (Barrow Type A),"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09232021, the case describes a 63-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus who experienced sudden proptosis following a fall with a blow to the neck, accompanied by a slight fever. Initial treatment for suspected orbital cellulitis was ineffective.

Given this clinical scenario, five initial differential diagnoses could include:

1. Orbital cellulitis
2. Traumatic injury to the orbit with hematoma
3. Carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF)
4. Orbital fracture with muscle entrapment
5. Neoplastic process causing orbital mass effect

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09232021/tab-legends, which include axial CT of the orbit showing right proptosis and edema of the ipsilateral extraocular muscles, dilation of the superior ophthalmic vein, early opacification of the cavernous sinus, and irregularity of the cervical segment of the internal carotid arteries (ICAs), the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF) - The imaging findings of dilated superior ophthalmic vein, early opacification of the cavernous sinus, and irregularity of the ICAs are highly suggestive of a CCF, particularly post-traumatic in nature.
2. Orbital cellulitis - While initially suspected, the lack of response to antibiotics and corticosteroids, along with the imaging findings, make this less likely.
3. Cavernous sinus thrombosis - This could present with similar imaging findings, but the presence of a CCF would be more consistent with the trauma history and imaging features.
4. Orbital fracture with vascular injury - The trauma could have caused a fracture leading to vascular injury, but the specific imaging findings point more towards a CCF.
5. Neoplastic process - While a neoplasm could cause proptosis and orbital changes, the acute presentation and imaging findings are not typical for a neoplastic process.

Given the imaging findings and clinical history, the most likely diagnosis is a carotid-cavernous fistula. The confidence level in this revised diagnosis is high, approximately 90-95%, due to the characteristic imaging features that align with the patient's history of trauma and subsequent symptoms.",90,Excellent
2021,Trochleitis with Acquired Brown Syndrome,"Based on the summary of the case presented on the American Journal of Neuroradiology website at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10072021, a 63-year-old man with acute itchy right eye, clear drainage, eye ache, and double vision, and a remarkable exam finding of decreased superior gaze while the eye was adducted, the following five differential diagnoses could be considered:

1. Orbital myositis
2. Superior oblique (SO) palsy
3. Trochlear nerve (CN IV) palsy
4. Brown syndrome
5. Orbital cellulitis or abscess

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10072021/tab-legends, which describe diffuse thickening and enhancement of the left superior oblique muscle with constriction at the level of the thickened and enhancing trochlea, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Trochleitis - The imaging findings of thickening and enhancement of the trochlea are characteristic of trochleitis.
2. Superior oblique myositis - The thickening and enhancement of the SO muscle could also suggest myositis.
3. Brown syndrome - This condition is associated with abnormalities of the SO tendon sheath or trochlea, which could be consistent with the imaging findings.
4. Orbital inflammatory syndrome - This broader category could encompass trochleitis and myositis.
5. Orbital cellulitis - While the imaging findings are not typical for cellulitis, it could present with muscle enhancement and should be considered.

Given the specific imaging findings of trochlear thickening and enhancement, the most likely diagnosis is trochleitis, with a confidence level of approximately 85-90%. This condition is consistent with the patient's symptoms and the imaging characteristics. The other conditions listed are differential considerations that could present with similar symptoms but are less likely given the imaging findings.",85,Good
2020,Acute Necrotizing Encephalopathy (ANE) Triggered by Influenza,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10292020, a 3-year-old girl presented with a progressive comatose state 3 hours following a simple febrile seizure, with a history of upper respiratory tract infection and a positive test for influenza. The following five differential diagnoses could be considered:

1. Acute encephalitis
2. Postictal encephalopathy
3. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)
4. Influenza-associated encephalopathy
5. Reye syndrome

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10292020/tab-legends, which describe MR images showing abnormal ""trilaminate"" signal within the thalami, a peripheral rim of vasogenic edema, underlying cytotoxic edema with restricted diffusion, central pinpoint of hemorrhage, faint ring enhancement within the thalami, and signal abnormality of bilateral cerebellar gray matter, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) - The ""trilaminate"" appearance on MRI and the association with influenza infection are characteristic of ANE.
2. Influenza-associated encephalopathy - This remains a consideration given the positive influenza test and the acute neurological presentation.
3. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) - While ADEM can present with similar symptoms and MRI findings, the ""trilaminate"" appearance is more specific to ANE.
4. Encephalitis due to other etiologies - Other infectious causes of encephalitis could present similarly but may not show the specific imaging pattern seen in ANE.
5. Reye syndrome - This is a less likely diagnosis given the imaging findings, but it is a consideration in the context of influenza infection and acute neurological deterioration.

Given the imaging findings and the clinical context of a recent febrile seizure and influenza infection, the most likely diagnosis is acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE). The confidence level in this revised diagnosis is high, approximately 90-95%, due to the characteristic ""trilaminate"" MRI appearance and the clinical presentation that is strongly associated with ANE.",90,Excellent
2020,Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD),"Based on the initial description provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07022020, a 49-year-old man with a 3-month history of mental and behavioral dysfunction, the following five differential diagnoses could be considered:

1. Demyelinating disease (e.g., Multiple Sclerosis)
2. Central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis
3. Glioma or other primary CNS neoplasm
4. Infectious encephalitis (e.g., HIV, JC virus leading to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy)
5. Metabolic encephalopathy (e.g., due to vitamin B12 deficiency or other metabolic disorders)

After reviewing the additional imaging and clinical details provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07022020/tab-legends, which describe asymmetric frontal white matter high T2 lesion sparing cortex, peripheral diffusion restriction on DWI, irregular thick pseudonodular peripheral enhancement on postcontrast T1WI, white matter demyelination with intact cortex on histopathology, skin hyperpigmentation suggesting Addison disease, and faint symmetric increased signal along the corticospinal tract and cerebellar white matter on FLAIR, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Adrenoleukodystrophy/Adrenomyeloneuropathy - Given the skin hyperpigmentation suggesting Addison disease and the white matter changes, this is a strong possibility.
2. Autoimmune encephalitis - Could present with white matter lesions and enhancement, but less likely given the skin findings and histopathology.
3. CNS lymphoma - Can present with irregular enhancement and white matter lesions, but the histopathology and Addison disease signs point away from this diagnosis.
4. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) - Typically seen in immunocompromised patients and may show white matter lesions, but other findings are not typical for PML.
5. Mitochondrial disorders - Can present with various CNS symptoms and white matter changes, but the specific findings of Addison disease make this less likely.

Given the imaging findings, histopathology, and clinical presentation, including skin hyperpigmentation, the most likely diagnosis is adrenoleukodystrophy or adrenomyeloneuropathy, which are associated with Addison disease. The confidence level in this revised diagnosis is high, approximately 90-95%, due to the characteristic combination of neurological, skin, and histopathological findings.",90,Excellent
2020,Allergic Fungal Rhinosinusitis with Intracranial Extension,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03192020, a 27-year-old man with nasal congestion and facial pain for 1 week, with a history of nasal polypectomy at 16 years of age, the following five differential diagnoses could be considered:

1. Chronic sinusitis with or without acute exacerbation
2. Sinonasal polyposis with possible recurrence post-polypectomy
3. Invasive fungal sinusitis
4. Sinonasal carcinoma
5. Mucocele with secondary infection

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03192020/tab-legends, which describe heterogeneously dense subtotal opacification of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity, pressure erosions, bowing of the left lamina papyracea with ipsilateral proptosis, erosion of the fovea ethmoidalis and posterior frontal sinus wall with intracranial invasion, and isointense filling of the ethmoidal cells on T1WI with markedly hypointense content on T2WI and a hyperintense mucosal lining, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Invasive fungal sinusitis - The presence of bone erosion and intracranial invasion is highly suggestive of an aggressive process such as invasive fungal sinusitis, especially in the context of hypointense sinus content on T2WI.
2. Sinonasal carcinoma - The aggressive features and bone erosion could also be consistent with a malignancy such as sinonasal carcinoma.
3. Mucocele with secondary infection and possible intracranial extension - The imaging findings could be consistent with a complicated mucocele, although this is less likely given the extent of disease.
4. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, formerly Wegener's granulomatosis) - This condition can cause aggressive sinus disease with bone erosion, but it is less common.
5. Chronic sinusitis with superimposed acute infection - While chronic sinusitis is common, the extent of bone erosion and intracranial extension suggests a more aggressive process.

Given the imaging findings of bone erosion, intracranial invasion, and the signal characteristics of the sinus contents, the most likely diagnosis is invasive fungal sinusitis, with a confidence level of approximately 80-90%. This condition is consistent with the aggressive nature of the findings and the patient's history of nasal surgery, which may predispose to such infections. The other conditions listed are differential considerations that could present with similar symptoms but are less likely given the specific imaging findings and clinical context.",80,Insufficient
2020,Ancient Schwannoma,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06112020), we have a case involving a 44-year-old man with a history of left profound hearing loss and left peripheral facial palsy since childhood.

1. Vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma) - Given the involvement of the internal acoustic canal and cranial nerves VII and VIII, this is a strong possibility.
2. Labyrinthitis ossificans - Considering the bone remodeling and widening of the cochlear canal.
3. Congenital inner ear malformation - Still a possibility, but less likely given the described bone changes and multicystic lesion.
4. Cholesteatoma - Less likely given the multicystic appearance and signal intensity, but cannot be completely ruled out.
5. Neurofibromatosis Type II - Given the bilateral involvement and the patient's age, this could be a consideration if there are other neurofibromas or related findings.

Confidence Level: 85% (The confidence level is higher after reviewing the imaging findings, which provide more specific information to narrow down the differential diagnoses.)

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01232020/tab-legends), which describes an enlarged anterior frontal cortical vein, a rounded extra-axial lesion corresponding with a venous pouch, a small subdural hematoma, and an ill-defined shunting area, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) - Given the presence of an enlarged cortical vein, venous pouch, and shunting area.
2. Cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) - Less likely given the description, but still a consideration.
3. Subdural hematoma - Confirmed by the imaging findings.
4. Cavernous malformation - Less likely given the angiographic findings.
5. Carotid-cavernous fistula - Given the dilatation of the right ophthalmic artery and its ethmoidal branches, but less likely due to the location of the shunting.

Confidence Level: 90% (The confidence level is higher after reviewing the imaging findings, which provide more specific information to narrow down the differential diagnoses, particularly pointing towards a vascular lesion with a shunting component, such as a DAVF.)

2. Encephalocele
3. Lipoma
4. Epidermoid cyst
5. Lymphangioma

Confidence Level: 70% (This confidence level reflects the broad range of common pediatric scalp masses that could present in this manner, without specific imaging details.)

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02132020/tab-legends), which describes a subgaleal soft-tissue mass that follows CSF signal with intracranial communication via a sharply demarcated bony defect, a persistent falcine sinus, focal discontinuity of the superior sagittal sinus, and high abnormal insertion of the cerebellar tentorium with prominence of the supracerebellar cistern, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Encephalocele - Given the intracranial communication and CSF signal of the mass.
2. Meningocele - Similar to encephalocele but typically contains meninges and CSF without brain tissue.
3. Atretic cephalocele - Given the midline location and the bony defect.
4. Dural venous sinus malformation - Considering the venous anomalies described.
5. Arachnoid cyst - Less likely given the communication with the subgaleal space but could be considered due to the CSF signal.

2020,Nivolumab Autoimmune Limbic Encephalitis (ALE),"Based on the content provided from the first link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11262020, we have a case of a 42-year-old man with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma who presented with subacute confusion, memory disturbances, and ataxia. The initial MRI was unremarkable, but a follow-up MRI 1 month after presentation showed notable findings.

Before reviewing the imaging description from the second link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11262020/tab-legends, here are five differential diagnoses to consider for this case:

1. Metastatic brain disease: Given the patient's history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, it is possible that the cancer has spread to the brain.
2. Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis: This condition can be associated with cancer and could explain the confusion and memory disturbances.
3. Immune-mediated encephalitis: The patient was treated with nivolumab, an immunotherapy agent, which can sometimes trigger an immune response in the brain.
4. Infectious encephalitis: An infection could cause similar symptoms and would need to be ruled out.
5. Cerebrovascular event: A stroke or transient ischemic attack could present with acute neurological symptoms.

Confidence level: 70%

After reviewing the imaging description from the second link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11262020/tab-legends, the differential diagnoses may be revised as follows:

1. Limbic encephalitis: The bilateral mesial temporal lobe findings could be consistent with limbic encephalitis, which may be paraneoplastic or immune-mediated.
2. Metastatic brain disease: The enhancement on postcontrast T1 images could suggest metastases, although the pattern may not be typical.
3. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML): This is less likely given the enhancement, but PML can sometimes present with patchy T2 signal changes in the brainstem and temporal lobes.
4. Central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma: CNS lymphoma can present with similar MRI findings, including enhancement and increased FLAIR signal.
5. Autoimmune encephalitis: Given the recent immunotherapy, an autoimmune process could be responsible for the findings.

Confidence level: 85%

Here are five initial differential diagnoses to consider:

1. Inverting papilloma: A benign tumor that can cause local destruction and often presents with nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea.
2. Squamous cell carcinoma: A type of cancer that can occur in the nasal cavity and may present with a mass and symptoms of nasal obstruction.
3. Nasal polyps: Benign growths in the nasal cavity that can cause nasal obstruction and a reduced sense of smell.
4. Sarcoma: A group of malignant tumors that can occur in the nasal cavity and may present with a mass and bone erosion.
5. Esthesioneuroblastoma: A rare cancer that originates in the olfactory epithelium and can present with symptoms like a reduced sense of smell and a mass.

Confidence level: 60%

After reviewing the imaging description from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02202020/tab-legends, the differential diagnoses may be revised as follows:

1. Esthesioneuroblastoma: Given the location at the cribiform plate and the presence of a mass with cystic components, this tumor is a strong consideration.
2. Malignant sinonasal tumor: This could include squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma, given the extensive local destruction and mass effect.
3. Inverting papilloma: Although typically benign, it can be locally aggressive and cause bone erosion.
4. Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC): A highly aggressive and destructive tumor that can present with similar imaging features.
5. Lymphoma: Can present as a sinonasal mass, although it is less common for it to cause such extensive bone erosion.

Confidence level: 80%

The revised differential diagnosis takes into account the detailed imaging findings, including the erosion of the cribiform plate, the mass effect on the nasal cavity and sinuses, and the presence of cysts within the lesion. The confidence level is higher after reviewing the imaging description, as it provides more specific information to narrow down the potential diagnoses.

1. Traumatic brain injury with hemorrhage: Given the history of a fall, an intracranial hemorrhage such as a subdural hematoma or cerebral contusion could be present.
2. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy: This condition can cause spontaneous lobar hemorrhages, especially in the elderly.
3. Hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage: High blood pressure can lead to bleeding within the brain tissue.
4. Ruptured cerebral aneurysm: Although the brief loss of consciousness could be due to other causes, a ruptured aneurysm could lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage.
5. Cerebral infarction with hemorrhagic transformation: An ischemic stroke that has undergone hemorrhagic conversion could present with these symptoms.

Confidence level: 50%

After reviewing the imaging description from the second link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09242020/tab-legends, the differential diagnoses may be revised as follows:

1. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH): The presence of hemorrhage in the ambient and quadrigeminal cisterns, as well as the cerebellopontine angle cistern, is indicative of SAH.
2. Traumatic brain injury with secondary hemorrhage: The fall could have caused a traumatic SAH.
3. Ruptured vascular malformation: The absence of a circle of Willis aneurysm on TOF MRA suggests the possibility of another vascular abnormality.
4. Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT): The patency of the transverse sinus is noted, but hemorrhage could be due to CVT in another location.
5. Hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage: Although less likely given the pattern of hemorrhage, it cannot be completely ruled out without further clinical information.

Confidence level: 75%

The revised differential diagnosis takes into account the detailed imaging findings, which include hemorrhage in multiple cisterns and the absence of an aneurysm on MRA. The confidence level is higher after reviewing the imaging description, as it provides more specific information to narrow down the potential diagnoses. However, the final diagnosis would require correlation with the patient's full clinical picture, including blood pressure readings, coagulation profile, and further imaging studies if necessary.",75,Excellent
2020,Petrous Apex Chondrosarcoma in Ollier Disease (Enchondromatosis),"Based on the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09032020, a 14-year-old patient presents with diplopia and headaches for 1 year, accompanied by right cranial nerve VI palsy. Here are five initial differential diagnoses to consider:

1. Cholesteatoma: A benign growth of keratinizing squamous epithelium in the middle ear or petrous apex that can cause local bone erosion.
2. Rhabdomyosarcoma: A malignant soft tissue tumor that can occur in the head and neck region, particularly in children and adolescents.
3. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH): A disorder characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, which can affect the skull and lead to bone lesions.
4. Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA): A benign but locally aggressive vascular tumor that typically occurs in adolescent males and can involve the skull base.
5. Eosinophilic granuloma: A form of LCH that specifically affects the bones and can cause lytic lesions.

Confidence level: 60%

After reviewing the imaging description from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09032020/tab-legends, the differential diagnoses may be revised as follows:

1. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH): The presence of lytic bone lesions with endosteal scalloping and punctate internal calcifications is characteristic of LCH.
2. Fibrous dysplasia: A benign bone disorder that can cause expansile, lobulated masses, although the presence of multiple lesions may be less typical.
3. Eosinophilic granuloma: A localized form of LCH that can present with similar radiographic features.
4. Metastatic disease: While less common in this age group, the presence of multiple lesions raises the possibility of metastases.
5. Brown tumor of hyperparathyroidism: These lesions can appear as lytic bone lesions, but other clinical signs of hyperparathyroidism would be expected.

Confidence level: 80%

The revised differential diagnosis takes into account the detailed imaging findings, which include a lytic mass with a narrow zone of transition and punctate internal calcifications in the right petrous apex, as well as multiple lucent lesions in the bones of the hand, scapula, and ribs. The presence of multiple lesions across different bones increases the likelihood of a systemic process such as LCH. The confidence level is higher after reviewing the imaging description, as it provides more specific information to narrow down the potential diagnoses. However, the final diagnosis would require correlation with the patient's full clinical picture, including laboratory results and potentially a biopsy of one of the lesions.",80,Insufficient
2020,Pituitary Stalk Tuberculoma,"Based on the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12032020, a 25-year-old woman presents with a history of progressive painless deterioration of vision (right greater than left) and amenorrhea.

1. Pituitary adenoma: A common benign tumor of the pituitary gland that can cause visual impairment and hormonal disturbances, including amenorrhea.
2. Craniopharyngioma: A benign, slow-growing tumor that can affect the pituitary stalk and cause visual and endocrine symptoms.
3. Meningioma: A benign tumor that arises from the meninges and can compress adjacent structures, potentially leading to visual deterioration.
4. Rathke's cleft cyst: A benign cystic lesion arising from remnants of Rathke's pouch that can cause visual and hormonal symptoms if it enlarges.
5. Prolactinoma: A benign pituitary tumor that secretes prolactin, leading to amenorrhea, and can cause visual field defects if large enough.

Confidence level: 70%

After reviewing the imaging description from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12032020/tab-legends, the differential diagnoses may be revised as follows:

1. Tuberculous meningitis with granuloma: The presence of caseous necrosis with granulomatous inflammation and no tumor cells on histopathology, along with the location of the lesion, suggests a granulomatous process like tuberculosis.
2. Sarcoidosis: Another granulomatous disease that can affect the central nervous system and present with similar imaging findings.
3. Lymphocytic hypophysitis: An autoimmune inflammation of the pituitary gland, which can present with stalk thickening and enhancement, although caseous necrosis is not typical.
4. Germinoma: A type of germ cell tumor that can occur in the suprasellar region, but the lack of tumor cells on histopathology makes this less likely.
5. Pituitary adenoma with infarction/necrosis: While pituitary adenomas are common, the presence of caseous necrosis is not typical and would be unusual without prior intervention.

Confidence level: 90%

The revised differential diagnosis takes into account the detailed imaging findings and the histopathology report, which indicates caseous necrosis with granulomatous inflammation and no tumor cells. The presence of granulomatous inflammation is highly suggestive of an infectious or inflammatory process rather than a neoplastic one, with tuberculosis being a leading consideration given the histopathological findings. The confidence level is higher after reviewing the imaging description and histopathology, as they provide specific information that points towards a granulomatous disease. However, the final diagnosis would require correlation with the patient's full clinical picture, including additional laboratory and possibly microbiological studies.",90,Excellent
2020,Primary Extradural Meningioma,"Based on the content from the first link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08272020, a 37-year-old woman presents with daily headaches, right ear drainage and hearing loss, and facial nerve weakness for 1 year.

1. Cholesteatoma: A benign growth of keratinizing squamous epithelium that can cause local destruction, hearing loss, and possibly facial nerve weakness.
2. Glomus jugulare tumor (Paraganglioma): A vascular tumor that can arise in the temporal bone and cause hearing loss and other cranial nerve deficits.
3. Middle ear carcinoma: A malignant tumor that can present with ear drainage, hearing loss, and facial nerve palsy.
4. Otitis media with complications: Chronic ear infections can lead to complications such as mastoiditis, which can cause hearing loss and facial nerve weakness.
5. Acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma): A benign tumor of the cranial nerve VIII that can cause hearing loss and, in large cases, facial nerve weakness.

Confidence level: 60%

After reviewing the imaging description from the second link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08272020/tab-legends, the differential diagnoses may be revised as follows:

1. Cholesteatoma: The sclerosis of the petrous portion of the right temporal bone and enlargement of the facial nerve canal are consistent with complications from a cholesteatoma.
2. Middle ear carcinoma: The presence of an enhancing mass in the temporal bone with extension into the tympanic cavity and external auditory canal raises the possibility of a malignant process.
3. Glomus jugulare tumor: These tumors can enhance and cause bony changes, although they typically arise from the jugular bulb.
4. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH): This can cause lytic bone lesions and mass effect, but the sclerosis seen on CT is less typical.
5. Rhabdomyosarcoma: A malignant tumor that can occur in the head and neck region of children and young adults, presenting with aggressive local invasion.

Confidence level: 75%

The revised differential diagnosis takes into account the detailed imaging findings, which include sclerosis of the petrous bone, enlargement of the facial nerve canal, and an enhancing lesion extending into the tympanic cavity and external auditory canal. The presence of an enhancing mass with these specific features increases the likelihood of a neoplastic process, with cholesteatoma and middle ear carcinoma being strong considerations. The confidence level is higher after reviewing the imaging description, as it provides more specific information to narrow down the potential diagnoses. However, the final diagnosis would require correlation with the patient's full clinical picture, including further imaging, laboratory results, and possibly a biopsy.",75,Insufficient
2020,Primary Familial Brain Calcification,"Based on the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01022020, a 15-year-old boy presented to the emergency department with a seizure following two head injuries sustained 3 days earlier during a game of rugby. Here are five initial differential diagnoses to consider:

1. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) with contusion: The recent head injuries and seizure could indicate a cerebral contusion or other traumatic injury.
2. Epidural hematoma: A collection of blood between the dura mater and the skull, often associated with head trauma.
3. Subdural hematoma: A collection of blood on the surface of the brain, beneath the dura, which can occur after head trauma.
4. Concussion: A mild TBI that can cause a variety of symptoms, including seizures, especially if there was a second impact.
5. Diffuse axonal injury (DAI): A form of traumatic brain injury that can cause seizures and is characterized by widespread damage to the brain's white matter.

Confidence level: 70%

After reviewing the imaging description from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01022020/tab-legends, the differential diagnoses may be revised as follows:

1. Genetic/metabolic disorder: The presence of abnormal findings in both the patient and the mother suggests a hereditary condition, such as a metabolic disorder.
2. Neurodegenerative disorder with familial pattern: The imaging findings could indicate a neurodegenerative process that is inherited.
3. Mitochondrial disorder: These often have neurological manifestations and can present with seizures and characteristic imaging findings.
4. Wilson's disease: A disorder of copper metabolism that can lead to abnormal brain imaging findings and neurological symptoms.
5. Toxic/metabolic encephalopathy: Exposure to certain substances or metabolic derangements can cause brain abnormalities and seizures.

Confidence level: 85%

The revised differential diagnosis takes into account the imaging findings in both the patient and the mother, which include high attenuation within the frontal white matter and pallidum, as well as low signal on T2-weighted gradient-echo images in the dentate nuclei and cerebellar hemispheres. These findings suggest a systemic or genetic condition rather than an acute traumatic injury. The confidence level is higher after reviewing the imaging description, as it provides more specific information to narrow down the potential diagnoses. However, the final diagnosis would require correlation with the patient's full clinical picture, including detailed family history, laboratory results, and possibly genetic testing.",85,Insufficient
2020,Sinonasal Eosinophilic Angiocentric Fibrosis,"Based on the summary of the case content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11052020, a 69-year-old man presents with bilateral epiphora and nasal swelling. Here are five initial differential diagnoses to consider:

1. Nasal polyps: Benign growths in the nasal cavity that can cause nasal obstruction and epiphora due to blockage of the nasolacrimal ducts.
2. Sinonasal carcinoma: A malignant tumor in the nasal cavity or sinuses that can cause swelling and obstruct the nasolacrimal ducts.
3. Wegener's granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis): An autoimmune condition that can cause nasal cartilage thickening and inflammation.
4. Sarcoidosis: A systemic disease characterized by non-caseating granulomas that can affect the nasal cartilage and cause swelling.
5. Chondrosarcoma: A malignant tumor of cartilage that can present with nasal cartilage thickening and mass effect.

Confidence level: 60%

After reviewing the imaging description from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11052020/tab-legends, the differential diagnoses may be revised as follows:

1. Relapsing polychondritis: The marked symmetric thickening of nasal septal and lateral nasal cartilages with moderate contrast enhancement is characteristic of this condition.
2. Sarcoidosis: Can cause thickening of nasal cartilages, although it typically has a different pattern of involvement.
3. Wegener's granulomatosis: Can lead to nasal cartilage thickening, but usually presents with more aggressive erosive changes.
4. Chondrosarcoma: A rare possibility, but the symmetric nature and moderate enhancement pattern are less typical for this malignancy.
5. Lymphoma: Can present with nasal swelling and might involve the cartilage, but the pattern of thickening and enhancement would be unusual.

Confidence level: 85%

The revised differential diagnosis takes into account the detailed imaging findings, which include symmetric thickening of the nasal septal and lateral nasal cartilages with extension into the inferior aspects of the nasolacrimal ducts, and the cartilages being T1 and T2 hypointense with moderate contrast enhancement. The presence of a right-sided dacryocystocele also supports the diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis, which can cause dacryocystitis as a complication. The confidence level is higher after reviewing the imaging description, as it provides more specific information to narrow down the potential diagnoses. However, the final diagnosis would require correlation with the patient's full clinical picture, including symptoms, laboratory results, and potentially a biopsy.",85,Insufficient
2020,Sinonasal Organized Hematoma,"Based on the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04302020, a 24-year-old man presented with an 8-month history of progressive left-sided nasal obstruction and a large, friable tumor at the anterior nasal sill. Here are five initial differential diagnoses to consider:

1. Inverted papilloma: A benign sinonasal tumor that can be locally aggressive and often presents with nasal obstruction and epistaxis.
2. Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA): A benign vascular tumor that typically affects adolescent males and can present with nasal obstruction and epistaxis.
3. Squamous cell carcinoma of the sinonasal tract: A malignant tumor that can present with nasal obstruction and a mass in the nasal cavity.
4. Nasal polyps: Benign mucosal growths that can cause nasal obstruction but are less likely to present as a friable tumor.
5. Hemangioma: A benign vascular tumor that can sometimes present as a friable mass and cause nasal obstruction.

Confidence level: 65%

After reviewing the imaging description from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04302020/tab-legends, the differential diagnoses may be revised as follows:

1. Fungal sinusitis: The presence of multiple hemorrhagic foci and a hypointense peripheral rim could suggest a fungal infection, which can cause an expansile mass.
2. Antrochoanal polyp: A benign lesion that arises from the maxillary sinus and extends into the nasopharynx, although the hemorrhagic foci would be atypical.
3. Inverted papilloma: The expansile nature of the mass and its heterogeneous signal intensity on T2 are consistent with this diagnosis, but the presence of hemorrhagic foci would be less typical.
4. Sinonasal carcinoma: The irregular nodular central enhancement and the expansile nature of the mass could indicate a malignant process.
5. Lymphoma: Can present as a sinonasal mass with bone remodeling and enhancement, though the hemorrhagic foci would be unusual.

Confidence level: 75%

The revised differential diagnosis takes into account the detailed imaging findings, which include a large expansile sinonasal mass centered in the left maxillary sinus cavity with marked heterogeneous signal intensity on T2, multiple hemorrhagic foci on SWI, and irregular nodular central enhancement. The presence of subtle cortical thinning and scalloping of the bony walls of the left maxillary sinus without evidence of cortical disruption suggests a process that is aggressive but may not be overtly malignant. The confidence level is higher after reviewing the imaging description, as it provides more specific information to narrow down the potential diagnoses. However, the final diagnosis would require correlation with the patient's full clinical picture, including endoscopic examination, biopsy, and possibly laboratory and microbiological studies.",75,Insufficient
2020,SMART Syndrome,"Based on the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01162020, a 69-year-old woman presented with migrainous headaches, clonic seizures of left limbs, and left homonymous hemianopsia and hemiparesis. She had a resective surgery of a right parieto-occipital meningioma followed by radiotherapy 15 years ago. Here are five initial differential diagnoses to consider:

1. Radiation necrosis: A delayed complication of radiotherapy that can cause neurological deficits and seizures.
2. Recurrent meningioma: The history of meningioma and subsequent treatment raises the possibility of recurrence.
3. Cerebrovascular accident (stroke): The acute onset of hemiparesis and hemianopsia could be due to a stroke.
4. Post-surgical changes with gliosis: Scarring and gliosis from previous surgery can sometimes lead to seizures and neurological deficits.
5. Metastatic disease: Although the patient has a history of meningioma, the possibility of a new primary cancer with brain metastases should be considered.

Confidence level: 70%

After reviewing the imaging description from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01162020/tab-legends, the differential diagnoses may be revised as follows:

1. Radiation necrosis: The imaging findings of postsurgical changes in the right parietal region and bilateral posterior postradiation leukoencephalopathy, along with gyriform swelling and cortico-pial hyperintensity and enhancement, are consistent with radiation necrosis.
2. Recurrent meningioma: Despite the absence of signs of meningioma recurrence on imaging, it remains a differential diagnosis given the patient's history.
3. Cerebral ischemia: The symptoms could be due to ischemic changes, although the imaging findings would be less typical for an acute stroke.
4. Inflammatory process: An autoimmune or inflammatory condition could cause similar imaging findings, though it would be less common in this context.
5. Infectious encephalitis: Infections can lead to enhancement and swelling, but the bilateral and symmetrical pattern would be unusual.

Confidence level: 85%

The revised differential diagnosis takes into account the detailed imaging findings, which include postsurgical changes and bilateral posterior postradiation leukoencephalopathy, as well as gyriform swelling and cortico-pial hyperintensity and enhancement in the right parietal region. The absence of signs of meningioma recurrence and the presence of postradiation changes suggest that radiation necrosis is a likely diagnosis. The confidence level is higher after reviewing the imaging description, as it provides more specific information to narrow down the potential diagnoses. However, the final diagnosis would require correlation with the patient's full clinical picture, including the timeline of symptom development, response to treatment, and potentially further imaging or biopsy.",85,Insufficient
2020,Spinal Cord Decompression Sickness (SCDS),"Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology (AJNR) at the provided link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12102020, here are five initial differential diagnoses for the case:

1. Transverse Myelitis _ This condition can cause sensory level changes and weakness due to inflammation across both sides of one level of the spinal cord.
2. Spinal Cord Infarction _ The sudden onset and progression could be indicative of a vascular event, especially given the patient's history of deep-sea diving which could predispose to decompression sickness.
3. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) _ MS can present with patchy, longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions, although it typically would affect younger patients.
4. Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) _ This is another demyelinating disease that can cause longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions, but it often presents with optic neuritis.
5. Spinal Cord Tumor _ A primary or metastatic tumor could present with progressive neurological symptoms, although the rapid progression is less typical.

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging description from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12102020/tab-legends, which mentions longitudinally extensive, patchy, abnormal T2 signal within the spinal cord at T3_T5 levels, centered within the lateral right half of the cord, predominantly involving the central gray matter and some peripheral white matter, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Transverse Myelitis _ The involvement of central gray matter is consistent with this diagnosis.
2. Spinal Cord Infarction _ The lateralized and patchy nature of the lesion could suggest an infarct in a specific arterial territory.
3. Hematomyelia _ Bleeding into the spinal cord, possibly related to trauma or a vascular malformation, could also present with these findings.
4. Spinal Cord Abscess or Infection _ An infectious process could cause localized inflammation and edema with a similar imaging appearance.
5. Spinal Dural Arteriovenous Fistula (SDAVF) _ This vascular condition can lead to congestion and edema in the spinal cord, particularly affecting the central gray matter.

Confidence Level: 85%

It is important to note that the actual diagnosis would require correlation with additional clinical information, laboratory results, and potentially further imaging studies such as MRI with contrast or spinal angiography.",85,Insufficient
2020,"Stylocarotid Artery Syndrome (Eagle Syndrome, Vascular Variant)","Based on the clinical presentation of a 64-year-old man with sudden onset of right arm weakness, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the provided link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07302020, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Ischemic Stroke _ Sudden onset of unilateral weakness is highly suggestive of a cerebrovascular event.
2. Hemorrhagic Stroke _ Although less common than ischemic stroke, it can present with similar acute neurological deficits.
3. Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) _ A temporary blockage of blood flow to the brain that can cause similar symptoms to a stroke but typically resolves within a few hours.
4. Brain Tumor _ A mass effect from a tumor could cause localized weakness, although it usually presents more gradually.
5. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) _ MS can cause acute neurological symptoms due to demyelination, but it would be less common in this age group.

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging description from the diagram provided in the content at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07302020/tab-legends, which describes normal initial non-contrast CT (NECT), acute ischemic injury in the left MCA distribution on DWI, and an elongated left styloid process causing severe narrowing of the left internal carotid artery consistent with stylocarotid artery syndrome, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Stylocarotid Artery Syndrome (Eagle Syndrome) _ The imaging findings of an elongated styloid process impinging on the carotid artery leading to thrombus formation are pathognomonic for this condition.
2. Carotid Artery Dissection _ This can present with ischemic symptoms due to a tear in the carotid artery wall, but the imaging findings are specific for impingement by the styloid process.
3. Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease _ While this can cause ischemic strokes, the imaging findings do not support this as the primary cause.
4. Cardiac Embolism _ A cardiac source of embolism could cause multiple foci of ischemia, but again, the imaging findings point to a local vascular impingement.
5. Hypercoagulable States _ These could lead to thrombus formation, but the imaging findings suggest a mechanical cause.

Confidence Level: 95%

The imaging findings of an elongated styloid process with associated narrowing of the internal carotid artery and the presence of an intraluminal thrombus proximal to this narrowing strongly suggest a diagnosis of stylocarotid artery syndrome. The diagnosis is further supported by the clinical presentation of sudden onset right arm weakness and the distribution of ischemic injury in the left MCA territory, which corresponds to the side of the arterial impingement.",95,Excellent
2020,Sublingual Dermoid Cyst,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 15-year-old boy with a 3-month history of a painless, progressively enlarging mass on the floor of the mouth on the right side, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the provided link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07232020, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Ranula _ A mucous cyst that can form on the floor of the mouth.
2. Dermoid Cyst _ These are benign cysts that may contain various tissue elements and can occur in the head and neck area.
3. Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma _ A type of salivary gland cancer that can present as a mass in the mouth.
4. Lymphatic Malformation (Lymphangioma) _ A benign mass that can occur in the head and neck, often present from birth or early childhood.
5. Benign Salivary Gland Tumor _ Such as a pleomorphic adenoma, which can present as a painless mass.

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging description from the diagram provided in the content at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07232020/tab-legends, which describes a well-circumscribed, unilocular lesion with multiple round echogenic structures, hypointense corpuscles on T2-weighted imaging, mildly hyperintense corpuscles on T1-weighted imaging, and restriction of the corpuscles on the ADC map, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Dermoid Cyst _ The presence of keratinous substance and the imaging characteristics are consistent with a dermoid cyst.
2. Epidermoid Cyst _ Similar to dermoid cysts but typically do not contain skin appendages.
3. Ranula _ Especially if it is a plunging ranula, which extends into the neck, but the keratinous substance is not typical.
4. Lymphatic Malformation _ The imaging findings are less typical for this diagnosis.
5. Benign Salivary Gland Tumor _ The imaging findings and needle aspiration results make this less likely.

Confidence Level: 90%

The imaging characteristics and the aspirated substance suggest a diagnosis of a dermoid or epidermoid cyst, with the former being more likely due to the presence of fat within the lesion. The well-circumscribed nature and the imaging findings are key to narrowing down the differential diagnosis. It is important to note that the final diagnosis would require histopathological examination of the aspirated or excised lesion.",90,Excellent
2020,Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 5-year-old boy with acute right eye pain and swelling, progression to ophthalmoplegia, and a history of multiple instances of right eye pain and swelling with spontaneous resolution, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the provided link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08202020, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Orbital Cellulitis _ An infection of the tissues surrounding the eye, which can cause pain, swelling, and ophthalmoplegia.
2. Orbital Pseudotumor (Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation) _ A non-specific inflammatory condition that can mimic the symptoms of an infection or tumor.
3. Rhabdomyosarcoma _ A malignant tumor that can occur in the orbit and present with rapid onset of pain and swelling.
4. Optic Neuritis _ Inflammation of the optic nerve, which can cause pain and visual disturbances, though less likely to cause ophthalmoplegia.
5. Thyroid Eye Disease (Graves' Ophthalmopathy) _ An autoimmune condition that can cause inflammation and swelling in the orbit, leading to eye pain and movement restrictions.

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging description from the diagram provided in the content at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08202020/tab-legends, which describes a T2-hyperintense mass expanding the right cavernous sinus with avid enhancement but no restricted diffusion and no intraorbital involvement, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis _ Typically presents with pain, ophthalmoplegia, and can show a mass-like effect, but restricted diffusion would be expected.
2. Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome _ An idiopathic granulomatous inflammation of the cavernous sinus, which can cause painful ophthalmoplegia and responds well to corticosteroids.
3. Sphenoid Wing Meningioma _ These tumors can involve the cavernous sinus and cause similar symptoms, but would not typically decrease in size without treatment.
4. Lymphangioma _ A benign vascular malformation that can involve the cavernous sinus, though it is less common in this location.
5. Neurogenic Tumor _ Such as a schwannoma or neurofibroma, which can arise in the cavernous sinus and cause ophthalmoplegia.

Confidence Level: 85%

The imaging findings of a T2-hyperintense mass in the cavernous sinus with enhancement and no restricted diffusion, along with the clinical history of spontaneous resolution and response to corticosteroids, suggest an inflammatory process rather than a thrombotic or neoplastic one. Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome becomes a more likely diagnosis given these considerations, although definitive diagnosis would require further clinical correlation and potentially biopsy.",85,Excellent
2020,Transient Global Amnesia,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 49-year-old woman with sudden onset of anterograde amnesia, repetitive questioning, and dizziness, without other focal neurologic signs, and symptoms that resolved completely within the next 12 hours, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the provided link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10222020, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Transient Global Amnesia (TGA) _ A clinical syndrome characterized by sudden onset of amnesia and repetitive questioning with no other neurological deficits and complete resolution within 24 hours.
2. Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) _ A temporary period of symptoms similar to those of a stroke, which can include memory loss and dizziness.
3. Seizure _ Particularly a complex partial seizure, which can present with transient cognitive impairment and repetitive behaviors.
4. Migraine with Aura _ Some migraines can present with transient neurological symptoms, including amnesia and dizziness.
5. Hypoglycemia _ Low blood sugar can cause a variety of neurological symptoms, including memory issues and dizziness.

Confidence Level: 80%

After reviewing the additional imaging description from the diagram provided in the content at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10222020/tab-legends, which describes MRI findings performed 72 hours after symptom onset showing bilateral hippocampal hyperintense foci on DWI with corresponding low signal on ADC, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Transient Global Amnesia (TGA) _ The MRI findings of bilateral hippocampal lesions are characteristic of TGA, especially given the clinical presentation and complete resolution of symptoms.
2. Herpes Simplex Encephalitis (HSE) _ Typically presents with fever and altered mental status, but can sometimes present with isolated amnesia; however, the rapid resolution is not typical for HSE.
3. Ischemic Stroke _ The DWI and ADC findings could suggest ischemia, but bilateral hippocampal involvement is uncommon and the transient nature of symptoms is not typical.
4. Hypoxic-Ischemic Injury _ This can cause bilateral hippocampal damage, but the history does not suggest a hypoxic event.
5. Limbic Encephalitis _ An autoimmune or paraneoplastic syndrome that can affect the medial temporal lobes, but it usually does not resolve spontaneously or rapidly.

Confidence Level: 95%

The clinical presentation and MRI findings are highly suggestive of Transient Global Amnesia, particularly given the transient nature of the symptoms and the characteristic imaging findings in the hippocampi. The absence of other neurological deficits and the complete resolution of symptoms within 24 hours further support this diagnosis.",95,Excellent
2020,Traumatic Vertebral Artery Injury (Dissecting Pseudoaneurysm),"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06252020), we have a case involving a 91-year-old woman with a history of a fall followed by severe neck pain.

2. Prader-Willi Syndrome
3. Bardet-Biedl Syndrome
4. Laurence-Moon Syndrome
5. Septo-optic dysplasia

Confidence Level: 70% (This confidence level reflects the consideration of the clinical features provided, but without specific imaging findings, the differential is broad.)

After reviewing the imaging findings from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05142020/tab-legends), which describe a normal pituitary gland and infundibulum, an incidental sphenoid sinus retention cyst, a bulbous, dysmorphic basal right frontal lobe with no olfactory sulcus or olfactory bulb/tract, deepening of the right cribriform plate, and gray matter heterotopias ipsilateral to the malformation, the differential diagnoses can be revised to focus on conditions associated with these imaging findings:

1. Kallmann Syndrome (olfactory bulb agenesis and associated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism)
2. Focal cortical dysplasia (given the presence of gray matter heterotopias)
3. Septo-optic dysplasia (although normal pituitary gland is noted, other features may suggest this diagnosis)
4. Holoprosencephaly spectrum disorder (given the dysmorphic basal frontal lobe, although typically more severe)
5. Schizencephaly (given the cortical malformation, although typically presents with clefts in the cerebral hemispheres)

Confidence Level: 85% (This confidence level is higher due to the specific imaging findings that guide the differential diagnosis. Kallmann Syndrome is particularly suggested by the combination of clinical and imaging findings, including the absence of the olfactory bulb/tract and associated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.)

It is important to note that the final diagnosis should be made in conjunction with a thorough clinical evaluation, including endocrinological workup and genetic testing if indicated. The imaging findings are critical in narrowing down the differential diagnosis and guiding further investigations.",85,Excellent
2020,Venolymphatic Facial Malformation,"Based on the incidental finding described in the content from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02062020), which mentions a 78-year-old man with ataxia and dysarthria, but without specific imaging details, here are five initial differential diagnoses that could be considered:

1. Cerebellar stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic)
2. Cerebellar tumor (e.g., metastasis, hemangioblastoma)
3. Degenerative cerebellar ataxias
4. Inflammatory or infectious process (e.g., cerebellitis, abscess)
5. Normal pressure hydrocephalus

Confidence Level: 50% (This confidence level reflects the broad nature of the differential diagnosis due to the lack of specific imaging details in the provided content.)

After reviewing the imaging findings from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02062020/tab-legends), which describe a multiloculated transspatial mass with T1 hypointensity and T2 hyperintensity, hypertrophy of the regional fat, phleboliths, heterogeneous enhancement, and fluid-fluid levels within the lesion, the differential diagnoses can be revised to focus on conditions associated with these imaging characteristics:

1. Cavernous hemangioma (given the presence of phleboliths and heterogeneous enhancement)
2. Lymphangioma (multiloculated transspatial mass, fluid-fluid levels)
3. Venous malformation (hypertrophy of regional fat, phleboliths)
4. Neurofibroma or schwannoma (if associated with nerve sheath, given the transspatial nature)
5. Sarcoma or other aggressive neoplastic processes (given the infiltrative nature and mass effect)

Confidence Level: 80% (This confidence level is higher due to the specific imaging findings that guide the differential diagnosis. The presence of phleboliths and the characteristics of the mass are suggestive of a vascular malformation or a benign tumor with secondary changes.)

It is important to note that the final diagnosis should be made in conjunction with a thorough clinical evaluation, including a detailed history, physical examination, and correlation with the imaging findings. The provided content is used to generate a hypothetical list of differential diagnoses, and in a real-world scenario, a clinician would also consider the patient's symptoms, physical exam findings, and additional diagnostic tests.",80,Good
2020,Vertebral Artery Transection Secondary to Penetrating Trauma,"Based on the content from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07092020), we have a case involving a 19-month-old girl with a foreign body in the oral cavity. Without specific imaging details, here are five initial differential diagnoses that could be considered for a pediatric patient with a foreign body in the oral cavity:

1. Aspiration pneumonia
2. Airway obstruction
3. Esophageal perforation
4. Abscess formation due to foreign body penetration
5. Foreign body ingestion with potential for gastrointestinal tract injury

Confidence Level: 50% (This confidence level reflects the broad nature of the differential diagnosis due to the lack of specific imaging details in the provided content.)

After reviewing the imaging findings from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07092020/tab-legends), which describe a cylindrical penetrating object passing through the right lateral pharynx, loss of flow at the distal V2 segment of the vertebral artery at the level of C2 with short segment flow void of V3 and retrograde flow via the basilar from the contralateral vertebral artery, sparing of the right internal carotid artery, an aberrant origin of the right subclavian artery passing posterior to the esophagus, and embolization of the V2 segment of the right vertebral artery, the differential diagnoses can be revised to focus on conditions associated with these imaging characteristics:

1. Penetrating neck injury with vascular trauma (vertebral artery injury)
2. Foreign body-induced vascular injury (arterial dissection or transection)
3. Esophageal injury with potential arterioesophageal fistula
4. Vascular anomaly complicated by foreign body injury (aberrant subclavian artery)
5. Hematoma or pseudoaneurysm formation secondary to penetrating injury

Confidence Level: 90% (This confidence level is higher due to the specific imaging findings that guide the differential diagnosis. The presence of a foreign body with associated vascular changes, including loss of flow in the vertebral artery and embolization, is highly suggestive of a vascular injury secondary to foreign body penetration.)

It is important to note that the final diagnosis should be made in conjunction with a thorough clinical evaluation, including a detailed history, physical examination, and correlation with the imaging findings. The provided content is used to generate a hypothetical list of differential diagnoses, and in a real-world scenario, a clinician would also consider the patient's symptoms, physical exam findings, and additional diagnostic tests.",90,Excellent
2019,IgG4-related Pachymeningitis,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03072019), which mentions a 53-year-old woman with intermittent neck pain and headaches but does not provide specific imaging details, here are five initial differential diagnoses that could be considered:

1. Cervical spondylosis
2. Migraine or tension-type headache
3. Cervical disc herniation
4. Vertebral artery dissection
5. Subarachnoid hemorrhage

Confidence Level: 40% (This confidence level reflects the broad nature of the differential diagnosis due to the lack of specific imaging details in the provided content.)

After reviewing the imaging findings from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03072019/tab-legends), which describe asymmetric pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement along the cerebral falx, left cerebellar tentorium, and left cerebellar convexity, with subtle hypointensity of the thickened dura along the left tentorium and no associated susceptibility effect, the differential diagnoses can be revised to focus on conditions associated with these imaging characteristics:

1. Idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis
2. Meningioma, particularly the en plaque subtype
3. Dural metastasis
4. Granulomatous disease (e.g., sarcoidosis, tuberculosis)
5. Inflammatory conditions (e.g., autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or IgG4-related disease)

Confidence Level: 80% (This confidence level is higher due to the specific imaging findings that guide the differential diagnosis. The asymmetric pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement are suggestive of a more localized dural process, which is characteristic of the conditions listed above.)

It is important to note that the final diagnosis should be made in conjunction with a thorough clinical evaluation, including a detailed history, physical examination, and correlation with the imaging findings. The provided content is used to generate a hypothetical list of differential diagnoses, and in a real-world scenario, a clinician would also consider the patient's symptoms, physical exam findings, and additional diagnostic tests.",80,Good
2019,Acute Hemorrhagic Encephalomyelitis (AHEM) Mimicking Abscess,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 52-year-old man with progressive, left-sided weakness and numbness for 2 weeks, as described in the content from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07042019), here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Ischemic stroke
2. Intracranial hemorrhage
3. Brain tumor (primary or metastatic)
4. Demyelinating disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis)
5. Infectious or inflammatory process (e.g., abscess, encephalitis)

Confidence Level: 50% - This confidence level is moderate due to the lack of specific imaging findings, which are crucial for narrowing down the differential diagnosis.

After reviewing the additional content from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07042019/tab-legends), which provides detailed imaging findings, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. High-grade glioma - The presence of a ring-enhancing lesion with central necrosis and surrounding edema is suggestive of a malignant primary brain tumor.
2. Metastatic brain tumor - Similar to high-grade glioma, metastases can present with ring-enhancing lesions and central necrosis.
3. Cerebral abscess - The ring-enhancing pattern with a central area of restricted diffusion could indicate an infectious process.
4. Demyelinating disease - The lesion's characteristics could also be seen in aggressive forms of demyelinating diseases, although less likely.
5. Vascular malformation with hemorrhage - The presence of micro-hemorrhages could suggest a vascular etiology, although the other imaging features make this less likely.

Confidence Level: 80% - The confidence level is higher after reviewing the imaging findings, which provide significant clues that are more suggestive of a neoplastic or infectious process. The detailed description of the imaging findings, particularly the ring-enhancing pattern and the presence of micro-hemorrhages, allows for a more targeted set of differential diagnoses.",80,Insufficient
2019,Acute Hyperammonemic Encephalopathy,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 23-year-old woman with multiple congenital cardiac anomalies, liver cirrhosis, abdominal distention, vomiting, constipation, and subsequent development of confusion and inability to follow commands, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy
2. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis with associated encephalopathy
3. Metabolic encephalopathy (e.g., electrolyte imbalance)
4. Intracranial hemorrhage or ischemic stroke
5. Central nervous system infection (e.g., meningitis or encephalitis)

Confidence Level: 60% - This confidence level is moderate due to the lack of specific imaging findings, which are essential for a more accurate differential diagnosis.

After reviewing the additional content from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08152019/tab-legends), which provides imaging findings of reduced diffusion in the bilateral insulae, cingulate cortex, and frontal cortex, with corresponding FLAIR hyperintensity and mild swelling of the temporal cortex, while sparing the basal ganglia and thalami, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Acute toxic-metabolic encephalopathy - The symmetrical involvement of the insulae, cingulate, and frontal cortex is suggestive of a metabolic cause.
2. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy - The distribution of the imaging findings could be consistent with hypoxic injury, which might occur in the context of cardiac or liver failure.
3. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) - This prion disease can present with rapidly progressive neurological decline and characteristic MRI findings, although it is less likely given the patient's acute presentation and known medical history.
4. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) - This inflammatory demyelinating disease can present with similar imaging findings but is less likely in the absence of a preceding infection or vaccination.
5. Mitochondrial encephalopathy - Given the patient's history of congenital anomalies and liver cirrhosis, a mitochondrial disorder could present with encephalopathy and characteristic imaging findings.

Confidence Level: 75% - The confidence level is higher after reviewing the imaging findings, which provide significant clues that are more suggestive of a toxic-metabolic or hypoxic-ischemic process. The detailed description of the imaging findings, particularly the symmetrical cortical involvement and sparing of the basal ganglia and thalami, allows for a more targeted set of differential diagnoses.",75,Good
2019,Acute Ischemia of the Mammillary Bodies,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 43-year-old man with acute onset short-term memory loss, as described in the content from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07112019), here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Transient ischemic attack (TIA)
2. Cerebral vascular accident (stroke)
3. Encephalitis
4. Epileptic amnesia (postictal state)
5. Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy (e.g., related to alcohol, drugs, or electrolyte imbalance)

Confidence Level: 50% - This confidence level is moderate due to the lack of specific imaging findings, which are essential for a more accurate differential diagnosis.

After reviewing the additional content from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07112019/tab-legends), which provides imaging findings of bilateral, symmetric high signal of the mammillary bodies on FLAIR-weighted MRI, high signal on DWI, and low values on the ADC maps consistent with acute ischemia, and subsequent normalization of the signal abnormalities with mild residual atrophy two weeks later, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Wernicke's encephalopathy - The classic involvement of the mammillary bodies and the reversibility of the imaging findings with residual atrophy are highly suggestive of this condition, which is often related to thiamine deficiency.
2. Hypoxic-ischemic injury - The symmetric nature of the findings could suggest a global hypoxic event, although this is less likely given the isolated mammillary body involvement.
3. Basilar artery stroke - A stroke in the territory of the basilar artery could potentially cause these findings, but would typically involve other areas as well.
4. Limbic encephalitis - This condition can affect the medial temporal lobes and other structures, but the mammillary bodies are not typically the primary site of involvement.
5. Metabolic disorders - Certain metabolic disorders can lead to bilateral lesions, but they would usually have a different distribution and not be limited to the mammillary bodies.

Confidence Level: 90% - The confidence level is high after reviewing the imaging findings, which are characteristic of Wernicke's encephalopathy. The involvement of the mammillary bodies, the clinical presentation of acute short-term memory loss, and the reversibility of imaging findings upon treatment are all consistent with this diagnosis.",90,Insufficient
2019,Acute parenchymal neuro-Beh_etfs disease,"Based on the clinical presentation of an 18-year-old woman with a history of unclassified inflammatory bowel disease and oral ulcers, presenting with acute onset of headaches, vomiting, blurred vision, and bilateral cerebellar syndrome, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Multiple sclerosis (MS) or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)
2. Cerebral vasculitis
3. Beh_et's disease
4. Central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma
5. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)

Confidence Level: 60% - This confidence level is moderate due to the lack of specific imaging findings, which are essential for a more accurate differential diagnosis.

After reviewing the additional content from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07182019/tab-legends), which provides imaging findings of bilateral symmetric areas of increased signal intensity involving the dorsal pons, corticospinal tracts, cerebellar peduncles, and posterior limb of the internal capsules with partial involvement of the lentiform nuclei and thalami, as well as involvement of the optic tracts and peripheral enhancement of the lentiform nuclei, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Beh_et's disease - Given the patient's history of oral ulcers and inflammatory bowel disease, along with the imaging findings, this could represent neuro-Beh_et's disease.
2. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) - The bilateral and symmetric involvement of white matter tracts is suggestive of ADEM.
3. Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) - The pattern of lesions and the patient's age may raise the suspicion for MELAS.
4. CNS vasculitis - The imaging findings could be consistent with vasculitis, particularly if there is an underlying systemic condition.
5. CNS lymphoma - While CNS lymphoma can present with multifocal lesions, the symmetric pattern is less typical.

Confidence Level: 75% - The confidence level is higher after reviewing the imaging findings, which provide significant clues that are more suggestive of an inflammatory or demyelinating process. The detailed description of the imaging findings, particularly the bilateral and symmetric involvement of specific brain regions, allows for a more targeted set of differential diagnoses.",75,Excellent
2019,ALVEOLAR PARAMENINGEAL RHABDOMYOSARCOMA,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 64-year-old woman with anosmia, a history of headaches, ageusia, and ventilatory insufficiency, as described in the content from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03142019), here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Sinonasal polyposis with possible secondary infection
2. Invasive fungal sinusitis
3. Sinonasal carcinoma
4. Wegener's granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis)
5. Sarcoidosis

Confidence Level: 60% - This confidence level is moderate due to the lack of specific imaging findings, which are essential for a more accurate differential diagnosis.

After reviewing the additional content from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03142019/tab-legends), which provides imaging findings of a homogeneous mass extending to the nasal cavity, anterior cranial fossa, and left orbit with erosion of surrounding bony structures, a heterogeneously hyperintense mass centered in the ethmoid sinus on T2 and STIR images, maxillary and frontal sinus secretion retention, invasion of the medial orbital wall with ipsilateral proptosis, and heterogeneous enhancement on T1 after contrast administration, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Sinonasal carcinoma - The aggressive nature of the mass with bony erosion and heterogeneous enhancement is suggestive of a malignant process.
2. Invasive fungal sinusitis - This can present with aggressive features and bony erosion, especially in immunocompromised patients.
3. Esthesioneuroblastoma - A rare cancer that originates in the olfactory epithelium and can present with similar imaging findings.
4. Lymphoma - Can present as a mass in the sinonasal region with bony destruction and invasion of adjacent structures.
5. Sarcoidosis or Wegener's granulomatosis - These granulomatous diseases can cause mass-like lesions and bony erosion, although they are less likely given the imaging characteristics.

Confidence Level: 85% - The confidence level is higher after reviewing the imaging findings, which provide significant clues that are more suggestive of a neoplastic process, particularly a sinonasal carcinoma or an aggressive fungal infection. The detailed description of the imaging findings, particularly the aggressive nature of the mass and the pattern of invasion and enhancement, allows for a more targeted set of differential diagnoses.",85,Insufficient
2019,ANTI-NMDA RECEPTOR ENCEPHALITIS,"Based on the provided content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology's Case of the Week for June 27, 2019, available at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06272019, a 41-year-old right-handed man presented with complaints of forgetfulness and altered mentation for 2 months. Without specific imaging findings or additional clinical details, we can initially consider a broad range of differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Neurodegenerative disease (e.g., early-onset Alzheimer's disease)
2. Chronic encephalitis (e.g., due to viral or autoimmune etiologies)
3. Cerebral vasculitis
4. Metabolic encephalopathy (e.g., hepatic or uremic encephalopathy)
5. Neoplastic processes (e.g., low-grade glioma or lymphoma)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the content from https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06272019/tab-legends, which describes subtle, patchy hyperintense signals on T2 axial images of the postcentral cortex on the left side, diffuse signal abnormality with hyperintensity on FLAIR and DWI sequences involving the neocortex, medial occipital lobes, limbic system, and no significant post-contrast enhancement, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Limbic encephalitis (autoimmune or paraneoplastic)
2. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) or other prion diseases
3. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)
4. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy
5. Viral encephalitis (e.g., herpes simplex virus)

The lack of significant post-contrast enhancement reduces the likelihood of neoplastic processes, and the involvement of specific brain regions such as the limbic system suggests a more targeted process like limbic encephalitis or prion disease.

Given the information provided and the typical imaging characteristics of these conditions, I would assign a confidence level of approximately 70% to this revised differential diagnosis list. It is important to note that further clinical correlation, laboratory testing, and possibly a biopsy would be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis.",70,Insufficient
2019,Arterial displasia in PHACE SYNDROME,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology's Case of the Week for September 12, 2019, available at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09122019, a 2-year-old girl presents with warm, reddish cutaneous and subcutaneous masses on both sides of her face, developmental delay, and poor vision. The initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms could include:

1. Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1)
2. Sturge-Weber syndrome
3. Juvenile xanthogranuloma
4. Hemangioma
5. Lymphatic malformation

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the content from https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09122019/tab-legends, which describes a Dandy-Walker malformation, enlarged posterior fossa, cystic dilation of the fourth ventricle, dysplastic ectatic arteries, and fusiform dilation of arteries, the differential diagnoses can be revised to:

1. PHACE syndrome (Posterior fossa malformations, Hemangiomas, Arterial anomalies, Cardiac defects, Eye abnormalities)
2. Dandy-Walker syndrome with associated vascular malformations
3. Wyburn-Mason syndrome
4. Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome (BRBNS)
5. Cobb syndrome

The imaging findings of Dandy-Walker malformation and dysplastic ectatic arteries are highly suggestive of a syndrome that includes both vascular and posterior fossa malformations. PHACE syndrome is a strong contender given the cutaneous findings and the posterior fossa abnormalities.

Given the imaging findings and the clinical presentation, I would assign a confidence level of approximately 90% to this revised differential diagnosis list. The specific imaging findings of Dandy-Walker malformation and arterial anomalies are characteristic of PHACE syndrome, which seems to be the most fitting diagnosis given the patient's presentation. However, further clinical correlation and genetic testing may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",90,Excellent
2019,Aspergillus Fumigatus Cerebral Abscess,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology's Case of the Week for June 20, 2019, available at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06202019, a 39-year-old man presents 5 days after a liver transplant with right temporal headache, subtle left hemineglect, and minimal weakness. The initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms could include:

1. Post-transplant infection (e.g., bacterial, fungal, or viral encephalitis)
2. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD)
3. Cerebrovascular accident (stroke)
4. Metabolic encephalopathy
5. Drug-induced neurotoxicity

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the content from https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06202019/tab-legends, which describes multiple, partially confluent frontoparietal ring-enhancing lesions with central restricted diffusion and surrounding edema consistent with abscesses, abnormal ependymal enhancement, and multiple small foci of signal dephasing on T2 GRE and SWI corresponding to microhemorrhages, the differential diagnoses can be revised to:

1. Pyogenic brain abscesses (e.g., bacterial)
2. Fungal abscesses (e.g., Aspergillus, Candida)
3. Cerebral toxoplasmosis
4. Metastatic disease
5. Septic emboli with associated hemorrhage

The imaging findings of ring-enhancing lesions with central restricted diffusion and surrounding edema are highly suggestive of infectious etiologies, particularly in the context of a recent liver transplant, which places the patient at an increased risk for opportunistic infections. The presence of microhemorrhages could indicate a septic embolic source or a hemorrhagic component to the lesions.

Given the imaging findings and the clinical context of a recent liver transplant, I would assign a confidence level of approximately 90% to this revised differential diagnosis list. The patient's immunocompromised status post-transplant significantly increases the likelihood of an infectious cause for the brain lesions. However, definitive diagnosis would require further investigation, including laboratory tests, cultures, and possibly biopsy of the lesions.",90,Good
2019,Bing-Neel syndrome (BNS),"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology's Case of the Week for September 19, 2019, available at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09192019, a 51-year-old man with a history of Waldenstromfs macroglobulinemia presents with progressive memory loss and episodes of spatial disorientation for the past 2 months. The initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms, considering his medical history, could include:

1. Bing-Neel syndrome (CNS involvement by Waldenstromfs macroglobulinemia)
2. CNS lymphoma
3. Metastatic disease
4. Infectious or inflammatory processes (e.g., encephalitis, vasculitis)
5. Cerebrovascular disease (e.g., ischemic stroke)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the content from https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09192019/tab-legends, which describes a cortico-subcortical left temporo-mesial hypodensity with an infiltrative left mesio-temporo lesion that shows high signal on FLAIR and T2-weighted images, intense and homogeneous enhancement after gadolinium administration, and diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement, the differential diagnoses can be revised to:

1. Bing-Neel syndrome
2. Primary CNS lymphoma
3. High-grade glioma (e.g., glioblastoma)
4. Infectious process (e.g., abscess, encephalitis)
5. Metastatic disease with meningeal involvement

The imaging findings of an infiltrative lesion with intense and homogeneous enhancement and the patient's history of Waldenstromfs macroglobulinemia strongly suggest Bing-Neel syndrome, which is a rare manifestation of Waldenstromfs macroglobulinemia involving the central nervous system. The differential also includes other neoplastic and infectious causes that could present with similar imaging findings.

Given the imaging findings and the patient's history of Waldenstromfs macroglobulinemia, I would assign a confidence level of approximately 85% to this revised differential diagnosis list. Bing-Neel syndrome is a strong contender given the patient's medical history and the imaging characteristics. However, other neoplastic and infectious processes cannot be completely ruled out without further diagnostic workup, including laboratory tests and possibly a biopsy.",85,Excellent
2019,Calvarial plasmacytoma as an initial presentation for multiple myeloma,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology's Case of the Week for February 14, 2019, available at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02142019, a 33-year-old man presented with 3 months of headaches and an enlarging bump on his head. The initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms and clinical presentation could include:

1. Osteoma
2. Dermoid cyst
3. Epidermoid cyst
4. Hemangioma
5. Meningioma

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the content from https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02142019/tab-legends, which describes a large 8.2 cm mildly hyperintense extra-axial mass over the bifrontal convexities that erodes the calvaria, is T2 hypointense suggesting high cellularity, compresses the underlying brain cortex without associated vasogenic edema, and shows avid enhancement post-contrast without other enhancing lesions in the brain or calvaria, the differential diagnoses can be revised to:

1. Meningioma
2. Metastatic disease
3. Lymphoma
4. Plasmacytoma
5. Fibrous dysplasia with associated soft tissue mass

The imaging characteristics of a large, extra-axial, hyperintense on T1, hypointense on T2, and avidly enhancing mass are most suggestive of a meningioma, especially given the absence of vasogenic edema and the erosion of the calvaria. Metastatic disease is also a consideration, but less likely in the absence of other lesions. Lymphoma, plasmacytoma, and fibrous dysplasia with associated soft tissue mass are less common but should be considered given the patient's age and the aggressive nature of the lesion.

Given the imaging findings and the clinical presentation, I would assign a confidence level of approximately 85% to this revised differential diagnosis list. Meningioma is the most likely diagnosis, but the other conditions listed should be ruled out with further diagnostic workup, including histopathological examination.",85,Good

The initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms could include:

1. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)
2. Meningioma
3. Craniopharyngioma
4. Optic neuritis
5. Sarcoidosis

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the content from https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11142019/tab-legends, which describes diffuse sclerosis and thickening of the bones of the face and skull, enlargement of the anterior clinoid processes causing narrowing of the optic nerve canals, diffuse hypointensity of the skull bones on T1-weighted imaging, bulging of the right optic nerve disc on T2-weighted imaging suggesting papilledema, and optic nerve atrophy worse on the right on coronal STIR imaging, the differential diagnoses can be revised to:

1. Fibrous dysplasia
2. Paget's disease of bone
3. Osteopetrosis
4. Hyperostosis frontalis interna
5. Sclerosteosis

The imaging findings of diffuse sclerosis and thickening of the bones, along with the clinical presentation of vision loss and papilledema, are suggestive of a process that affects the bone and potentially increases intracranial pressure or directly compresses the optic nerves. Fibrous dysplasia and Paget's disease are more common causes of such bone changes, while osteopetrosis, hyperostosis frontalis interna, and sclerosteosis are less common but should be considered given the imaging findings.

Given the imaging findings and the clinical presentation, I would assign a confidence level of approximately 80% to this revised differential diagnosis list. The specific pattern of bone changes and the associated symptoms strongly suggest a bone disorder affecting the skull and optic nerve canals. However, further clinical correlation and possibly genetic testing or bone biopsy would be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis.",80,Insufficient

5. Spinal tuberculosis (Pott disease)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the content from https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05232019/tab-legends, which describes a well-demarcated, extensive, intradural extramedullary solid lesion extending from T11 to S2, isointense to the spinal cord on T1 and slightly hyperintense on T2, displacing the spinal cord, causing dilatation of the distal ependymal canal, with homogeneous enhancement, widening of the spinal canal, neural foramen extension, posterior vertebral remodeling, and a short dural tail at the level of the conus without evidence of leptomeningeal enhancement, the differential diagnoses can be revised to:

1. Spinal cord ependymoma
2. Schwannoma
3. Neurofibroma
4. Meningioma
5. Lipoma

The imaging characteristics of a well-demarcated, homogeneously enhancing intradural extramedullary mass with a dural tail are suggestive of a tumor arising from the dura or nerve root sheath, such as a meningioma or schwannoma. Ependymoma is also a consideration, although it is typically intramedullary. Neurofibroma and lipoma are less likely but should be considered in the differential diagnosis of an intradural extramedullary spinal lesion in a child.

Given the imaging findings and the clinical presentation, I would assign a confidence level of approximately 75% to this revised differential diagnosis list. The imaging characteristics are quite specific for a neoplastic process, but the exact histological diagnosis would require further investigation, including surgical biopsy and histopathological examination.",75,Good
2019,Dyke-Davidoff-Masson Syndrome with Crossed Cerebellar Atrophy,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology's Case of the Week for January 3, 2019, available at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01032019, a 30-year-old woman with a history of stroke at age 5 presents with intractable epilepsy. The initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms and imaging findings could include:

1. Post-stroke sequelae with encephalomalacia
2. Rasmussen encephalitis
3. Sturge-Weber syndrome (without facial port-wine stain)
4. Cortical dysplasia
5. Low-grade glioma or glial scar due to old insult

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the content from https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01032019/tab-legends, which describes asymmetric left-hemispheric encephalomalacia and gliosis, compensatory changes including left frontal sinus and left trigone enlargement, left cranial vault thickening with widening of the left parietal diploic marrow space, and contralateral right cerebellar atrophy and gliosis, the differential diagnoses can be revised to:

1. Post-stroke changes with cerebral atrophy and associated compensatory skull changes
2. Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome (DDMS)
3. Hemimegalencephaly (unlikely given the history of stroke)
4. Silver-Russell syndrome (hemihypertrophy and possible cerebral involvement)
5. Glial scar due to old insult with secondary brain changes

The imaging findings of encephalomalacia, gliosis, and compensatory skull changes are suggestive of a chronic process that occurred early in life, such as the sequelae of a perinatal or childhood stroke. Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome is characterized by cerebral hemiatrophy, skull thickening, and sinus enlargement, which fits the imaging findings. The other conditions listed are less likely but included for completeness.

Given the imaging findings, the history of stroke, and the clinical presentation, I would assign a confidence level of approximately 90% to this revised differential diagnosis list. The history of stroke at a young age and the chronic nature of the imaging findings strongly suggest post-stroke sequelae and associated compensatory changes, which are characteristic of Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome. However, confirmation would require correlation with clinical history and possibly further diagnostic workup.",90,Excellent
2019,EIGHTH NERVE NEUROPATHY SECONDARY TO SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS (SLE),"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology's Case of the Week for August 29, 2019, available at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08292019, a 57-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presented with a 1-month history of vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and sensorineural hearing loss. The initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms, considering her medical history, could include:

1. Autoimmune-mediated inner ear disease (e.g., autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED))
2. Vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma)
3. Central nervous system vasculitis associated with SLE
4. Infectious labyrinthitis (e.g., viral, bacterial)
5. Meniere's disease

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the content from https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08292019/tab-legends, which describes an enhancing linear-shaped tissue in the internal auditory canal, associated pachymeningeal enhancement of the petrous apex, indistinct VII and VIII cranial nerves, and thickened cisternal segment of the CN V, with complete resolution of the findings after treatment, the differential diagnoses can be revised to:

1. Neuro-lupus with cranial neuropathy
2. Infectious or inflammatory process affecting the internal auditory canal and meninges (e.g., meningitis, labyrinthitis)
3. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis)
4. Sarcoidosis
5. Lymphoma

The imaging findings of enhancement in the internal auditory canal and pachymeningeal enhancement, along with the patient's history of SLE and the resolution after treatment, suggest an inflammatory or autoimmune process. Neuro-lupus, which can cause cranial neuropathies, is a strong consideration given the patient's underlying SLE. Other systemic inflammatory or granulomatous diseases such as GPA and sarcoidosis could also present with similar imaging findings and should be included in the differential. Lymphoma is less likely but included due to its potential to cause cranial nerve and meningeal involvement.

Given the imaging findings, the patient's history of SLE, and the clinical presentation, I would assign a confidence level of approximately 85% to this revised differential diagnosis list. The resolution of findings after treatment supports an inflammatory or autoimmune etiology, which is consistent with the patient's known SLE. However, definitive diagnosis would likely require further investigation, including laboratory tests and possibly a biopsy.",85,Excellent
2019,Epidural Lipomatosis with Post-operative Cord Infarct,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology's Case of the Week for June 6, 2019, available at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06062019, a 9-year-old boy with a BMI of 40 presents with worsening bilateral lower extremity weakness, gait abnormality for three months, bilateral lower extremity hyperreflexia, clonus, and positive Babinski. Four days postoperatively, he developed bilateral leg paralysis and a transient episode of hypotension. The initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms could include:

1. Spinal cord compression due to epidural lipomatosis
2. Tethered cord syndrome
3. Spinal cord tumor (e.g., astrocytoma, ependymoma)
4. Myelitis (e.g., transverse myelitis)
5. Guillain-Barr_ syndrome

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the content from https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06062019/tab-legends, which describes preoperative MRI findings of significantly narrowed central spinal canal with levels of effaced subarachnoid space and extensive dorsal epidural fat, and postoperative MRI findings of diffuse T2/STIR hyperintensity throughout the expanded cord, extending from C5 to conus, the differential diagnoses can be revised to:

1. Spinal cord compression due to epidural lipomatosis with subsequent postoperative edema or myelopathy
2. Acute spinal cord ischemia postoperatively, possibly due to hypotension
3. Postoperative spinal cord infarction
4. Acute transverse myelitis
5. Iatrogenic injury to the spinal cord during surgery

The imaging findings of extensive dorsal epidural fat preoperatively suggest spinal cord compression due to epidural lipomatosis, which could explain the preoperative symptoms. The postoperative changes with diffuse T2/STIR hyperintensity throughout the cord could be due to several causes, including ischemia, infarction, or myelitis, which may have been precipitated by the surgery or the episode of hypotension.

Given the imaging findings, the clinical presentation, and the postoperative course, I would assign a confidence level of approximately 80% to this revised differential diagnosis list. The preoperative and postoperative imaging findings, along with the clinical context, suggest a high likelihood of spinal cord compression followed by a postoperative complication such as ischemia or infarction. However, further clinical correlation and follow-up imaging would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of any permanent damage.",80,Excellent
2019,Extramedullary hematopoiesis,"Based on the provided content from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02212019), we have a case involving a 54-year-old man with low back pain and gait disturbance for 3 weeks.

Confidence Level: 60%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02212019/tab-legends), which describes sagittal T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) showing low signal within the bone marrow relative to intervertebral disc signal, posterior epidural masses from T4 to T7, and another nodular mass at the T9 level causing marked compression of the dorsal spinal cord, as well as multiple lobulated thoracic paravertebral masses bilaterally, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that can present with these imaging characteristics:

1. Metastatic disease (given the multiple masses and bone marrow signal changes)
2. Lymphoma (can present with multiple epidural and paravertebral masses)
3. Spinal epidural abscess (although less likely given the multiple levels involved)
4. Multiple myeloma (considering bone marrow signal changes and multiple masses)
5. Spinal meningioma or schwannoma (if the masses represent nerve sheath tumors)

Confidence Level: 85%

The revised differential diagnoses are more specific to the imaging findings described, which include multiple masses and bone marrow signal changes, suggesting a systemic process or a primary spinal pathology with multiple lesions.

1. Neurocysticercosis
2. Arachnoid cyst
3. Glioma (low-grade, given the lack of enhancement)
4. Thalamic stroke (though less likely without edema)
5. Pineal cyst (if the lesion is in proximity to the pineal region)

Confidence Level: 75%

The revised differential diagnoses are more specific to the imaging findings described, which include a multiloculated cystic lesion in the midbrain and thalamus without enhancement or edema.

1. Eosinophilic granuloma (Langerhans cell histiocytosis)
2. Fibrous dysplasia (less likely given the enhancement and absence of ground-glass appearance)
3. Meningioma en plaque (given the enhancement pattern)
4. Sarcoidosis (can cause lytic skull lesions)
5. Skull metastasis (less likely in a young patient without known primary cancer)

Confidence Level: 75%

The revised differential diagnoses take into account the specific imaging characteristics provided, including the pattern of bone destruction and enhancement.

2. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy
3. Diffuse axonal injury (DAI)
4. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)
5. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)

Confidence Level: 85%

The revised differential diagnoses take into account the specific imaging findings provided, which are suggestive of a diffuse process affecting the white matter with microbleeds and edema but without restricted diffusion, which is not typical for acute infarcts or classic infectious processes. The history of recent travel to a high-altitude area particularly raises the suspicion for HACE. It is important to correlate these imaging findings with the patient's clinical history, including the timeline of symptom onset and potential exposure to high altitude, and consider further diagnostic workup, such as laboratory tests or lumbar puncture, to reach a definitive diagnosis.",85,Excellent

1. Cortical dysplasia (confidence level: 60%) - The gyriform pattern and lack of enhancement could be consistent with cortical dysplasia.
2. Sturge-Weber syndrome without facial port-wine stain (confidence level: 50%) - The calcification and lack of typical vascular abnormalities could fit this diagnosis.
3. Oligodendroglioma (confidence level: 40%) - These can calcify and present with seizures, but are less common in this age group.
4. Ganglioglioma (confidence level: 50%) - These tumors often present with seizures and can have calcifications, but usually enhance.
5. Cerebral infarction (old) (confidence level: 30%) - While less likely due to the patient's age and lack of vascular abnormalities, an old infarct could present with calcification and seizures.

1. Optic nerve glioma (confidence level: 90%) - The imaging findings are highly suggestive of this diagnosis, particularly in the context of a child with visual pathway symptoms.
2. Optic nerve sheath meningioma (confidence level: 40%) - These can also cause optic nerve enlargement and proptosis, but are less common in this age group.
3. Retinoblastoma (confidence level: 20%) - While it can present with leukocoria, the MRI findings do not typically match those described.

An unenhanced CT was performed, and one-year interval follow-up showed mild progression, leading to MRI. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for this case:

1. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy
2. Marchiafava-Bignami disease
3. Gliosis secondary to trauma
4. Demyelinating disease (e.g., Multiple Sclerosis)
5. Infectious or inflammatory process (e.g., abscess, encephalitis)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04182019/tab-legends, which describe clustered hyperdense lesions along the corpus callosum and calloseptal interface with mild progression over a year, T1 hyperintensity, a ""popcorn"" appearance on T2 with central heterogeneous hypersignal and peripheral hypointense rim, associated avid blooming on GRE, and post-gadolinium T1 showing asymmetric prominence of the left septal vein, likely a developmental venous anomaly, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Cavernous malformations (confidence level: 80%) - The ""popcorn"" appearance on T2 and blooming on GRE are characteristic of cavernous malformations.
2. Developmental venous anomaly (confidence level: 70%) - The asymmetric prominence of the left septal vein supports this, although it is typically an incidental finding.
3. Central nervous system lymphoma (confidence level: 30%) - Can present with lesions along the corpus callosum but usually would enhance more uniformly.
4. Demyelinating disease (e.g., Multiple Sclerosis) (confidence level: 40%) - Lesions can occur in the corpus callosum but typically have a different imaging appearance.
5. Neurosarcoidosis (confidence level: 20%) - Can cause hyperdense lesions but would usually have more systemic manifestations.

The confidence levels are subjective estimates based on the imaging findings and clinical context provided. Further clinical correlation, laboratory tests, and potentially a biopsy would be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis.",80,Excellent
2019,Neurocysticercosis (NCC),"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10032019, we have a case of a 37-year-old woman with recurrent headaches. Without specific imaging findings, we can initially list a broad range of differential diagnoses for a patient with this clinical presentation:

1. Migraine
2. Tension-type headache
3. Cluster headache
4. Intracranial mass lesion (e.g., tumor, cyst)
5. Intracranial hemorrhage

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10032019/tab-legends, which describe right frontal calcification and hydrocephalus, an obstructive thin-walled cystic lesion within the 4th ventricle with an eccentric nodule that does not enhance, and restricted diffusion of the non-enhancing nodule on DWI and ADC maps, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Neurocysticercosis (confidence level: 80%) - The presence of calcification and a cystic lesion with an eccentric nodule is highly suggestive of this parasitic infection.
2. Ependymoma (confidence level: 60%) - These can present as cystic lesions with nodules, but typically enhance and are less likely to calcify.
3. Hemangioblastoma (confidence level: 50%) - These can present with cysts and a mural nodule, but the nodule usually enhances.
4. Arachnoid cyst (confidence level: 40%) - These are typically extra-axial and do not restrict on DWI, making this less likely.
5. Colloid cyst (confidence level: 30%) - These occur in the third ventricle and can cause hydrocephalus, but the imaging characteristics do not match perfectly.

The confidence levels are subjective estimates based on the imaging findings and clinical context provided. The presence of hydrocephalus and the specific imaging characteristics of the cystic lesion with an eccentric nodule that demonstrates restricted diffusion are key factors in narrowing down the differential diagnosis. Further clinical correlation, serological tests, and potentially a biopsy would be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis.",80,Excellent
2019,Orbital Xanthoma (Adult Onset Xanthogranuloma),"Based on the initial content summary from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08012019, we have a case of a 54-year-old woman with a 1-year history of slowly progressive left orbital proptosis and eyelid swelling, now with headache. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for this case:

1. Orbital pseudotumor (idiopathic orbital inflammation)
2. Thyroid eye disease (Graves' ophthalmopathy)
3. Orbital cellulitis/abscess
4. Orbital neoplasm (e.g., lymphoma, metastasis)
5. Lacrimal gland tumor

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08012019/tab-legends, which describe a T1 hypointense, homogeneously enhancing intraorbital mass with intracranial extension to the left cavernous sinus encasing the carotid artery without luminal reduction, dural thickening and enhancement in the left middle cranial fossa anterior to the temporal pole, and extension into the mid and posterior left ethmoid air cells and left sphenoid sinus, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Sphenoid wing meningioma (confidence level: 85%) - The homogenous enhancement, dural thickening, and intracranial extension are characteristic of meningioma.
2. Orbital pseudotumor (confidence level: 60%) - This can present with similar features but is less likely to have such extensive intracranial involvement.
3. Lymphoma (confidence level: 70%) - Lymphoma can present as an enhancing mass but may have more heterogeneous enhancement.
4. Metastatic disease (confidence level: 50%) - Metastasis can present with similar findings, but the homogeneity of the mass suggests a primary tumor.
5. Invasive fungal sinusitis (confidence level: 40%) - This can cause bony erosion and mass effect but typically presents acutely and is more aggressive.

The confidence levels are subjective estimates based on the imaging findings and clinical context provided. The presence of a homogeneously enhancing mass with both intraorbital and intracranial extension, as well as involvement of the cavernous sinus and dural thickening, are key factors in narrowing down the differential diagnosis. Further clinical correlation, laboratory tests, and potentially a biopsy would be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis.",85,Insufficient
2019,Parry Romberg Syndrome (PRS),"Based on the summary of the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08222019), we have a case of a 39-year-old woman with a 4-year history of seizures and no history of previous trauma. Without specific imaging findings or additional clinical information, we can list a broad range of differential diagnoses for seizures:

1. Epilepsy (idiopathic or symptomatic)
2. Brain tumor (primary or metastatic)
3. Cerebrovascular disease (stroke or arteriovenous malformation)
4. Infections (encephalitis, meningitis, brain abscess)
5. Autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus)

Confidence Level: 60%

After reviewing the additional information provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08222019/tab-legends), which includes a description of a band of brownish discoloration on the forehead, a whitish scar on the scalp, atrophy of the scalp and thinning of the calvarium in the left frontal region, hyperintensity in the centrum semiovale, occipital periventricular white matter, and temporal lobar white matter on FLAIR images, and multiple foci of susceptibility blooming consistent with microbleeds on the left cerebral hemisphere, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Sturge-Weber syndrome (given the facial port-wine stain and leptomeningeal angioma with calcifications and atrophy)
2. Rasmussen encephalitis (chronic inflammation, often unilateral, with seizures)
3. Cortical dysplasia (abnormal brain development leading to epilepsy)
4. Gliosis/post-inflammatory scarring (secondary to previous inflammation or trauma)
5. Vascular malformation (such as cavernoma, given the presence of microbleeds)

Confidence Level: 85%

The presence of unilateral findings, particularly the port-wine stain and the imaging characteristics, strongly suggest a neurocutaneous syndrome like Sturge-Weber syndrome. However, a definitive diagnosis would require correlation with clinical findings, possibly further imaging, and potentially histopathological confirmation.",85,Insufficient
2019,Perineural spread of squamous cell carcinoma to the greater auricular nerve,"Based on the summary of the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02282019), we have a case of a 65-year-old man with a past history of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the right pinna, presenting with formication around the right ear and external auditory canal. Without specific imaging findings, we can list a broad range of differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Recurrence of squamous cell carcinoma
2. Cutaneous metastasis
3. Parotid gland tumor
4. Neuralgia related to the cervical plexus
5. Inflammatory or infectious process affecting the ear or surrounding structures

Confidence Level: 50%

After reviewing the additional information provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02282019/tab-legends), which includes imaging findings of a cord-like structure running along the lateral aspect of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle, a thickened enhancing structure adjacent to the muscle, and an enhancing nerve adjacent to the parotid gland, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Schwannoma or neurofibroma of the cervical plexus
2. Metastatic lymphadenopathy
3. Parotid gland neoplasm with possible perineural invasion
4. Infectious or inflammatory lymphadenitis
5. Carotid body tumor or other paraganglioma

Confidence Level: 75%

The imaging findings suggest a lesion that involves the nerve, which is consistent with a nerve sheath tumor such as a schwannoma or neurofibroma. The history of SCC raises the possibility of metastatic disease or perineural invasion. The location and imaging characteristics would be less typical for primary neoplasms of the parotid gland or inflammatory processes. A definitive diagnosis would require correlation with clinical findings, possibly further imaging, and potentially histopathological confirmation.",75,Good
2019,Peripheral Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor,"Based on the summary of the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11282019), we have a case of a 49-year-old patient with new-onset bilateral lower extremity weakness, preserved continence, and saddle sensation. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Spinal cord compression due to a herniated disc
2. Spinal stenosis
3. Spinal cord tumor (e.g., ependymoma, astrocytoma)
4. Inflammatory or demyelinating disease (e.g., transverse myelitis, multiple sclerosis)
5. Vascular malformation or spinal cord infarction

Confidence Level: 60%

After reviewing the additional information provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11282019/tab-legends), which describes a heterogeneous mass at L1_L3, iso- to hyperintense on T2-weighted images, occupying the intradural space without medullary involvement, and showing severe compression and displacement of the conus and cauda equina nerve roots, as well as hyperintensity suggesting blood products and heterogeneous enhancement, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Spinal meningioma
2. Schwannoma or neurofibroma
3. Hemangioblastoma
4. Metastasis
5. Spinal ependymoma

Confidence Level: 85%

The imaging characteristics described, including the location, signal intensity, and enhancement pattern, are more suggestive of an intradural extramedullary tumor. Spinal meningiomas and nerve sheath tumors like schwannomas or neurofibromas are common in this space. Hemangioblastomas are also a consideration given the presence of blood products. Metastasis is always a differential in a mass lesion, and ependymomas, although typically intramedullary, can sometimes present in an extramedullary location. A definitive diagnosis would likely require further investigation, including a detailed clinical examination and possibly a biopsy.",85,Insufficient
2019,Persistent hypoglossal artery with synchronous left internal carotid and basilar artery occlusion,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04252019), we have a case of a 70-year-old man with sudden coma. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for this presentation:

1. Ischemic stroke
2. Hemorrhagic stroke
3. Subarachnoid hemorrhage
4. Intracranial mass effect (e.g., tumor, abscess)
5. Metabolic encephalopathy (e.g., hypoglycemia, hepatic or renal failure)

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional information provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04252019/tab-legends), which describes noncontrast brain CT findings of a hyperdense vessel sign in the basilar and left middle cerebral artery, CT-angiography confirming synchronous occlusion of the basilar artery and left internal carotid artery, and a persistent hypoglossal artery explaining the synchronous multi-territory stroke, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Acute basilar artery occlusion
2. Acute left middle cerebral artery occlusion
3. Concurrent basilar and carotid artery occlusion due to a cardioembolic source
4. Dissection of the cervical arteries
5. Hypercoagulable state leading to multiple arterial occlusions

Confidence Level: 95%

The imaging findings and clinical presentation are highly suggestive of an acute ischemic stroke involving multiple vascular territories. The presence of a persistent hypoglossal artery, a rare anatomic variant, provides a plausible explanation for the synchronous occlusions observed. The revised differential diagnosis is focused on vascular causes of coma, which aligns with the imaging findings. A definitive diagnosis would likely involve further investigation into the etiology of the stroke, including cardiac evaluation and blood tests for hypercoagulability.",95,Good
2019,Piriformis syndrome caused by a split piriformis muscle,"Based on the summary of the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05022019), a 58-year-old man presents with persistent lower back pain radiating down the right leg, accompanied by loss of sensation along his posterior thigh, leg, and the lateral portion of his foot. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Lumbar disc herniation with nerve root compression
2. Lumbar spinal stenosis
3. Sciatica, possibly due to piriformis syndrome
4. Spondylolisthesis
5. Spinal tumors or metastases affecting the nerve roots

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional information provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05022019/tab-legends), which describes imaging findings of the right S1 nerve coursing through the piriformis muscle and an incidentally noted left-sided nerve sheath tumor, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Piriformis syndrome with possible S1 nerve entrapment
2. Lumbar disc herniation with S1 radiculopathy
3. Schwannoma or neurofibroma (for the left-sided nerve sheath tumor)
4. Lumbar spinal stenosis with S1 nerve root involvement
5. Spondylolisthesis with nerve root compression

Confidence Level: 90%

The imaging findings and clinical presentation are highly suggestive of piriformis syndrome, which can cause entrapment of the sciatic nerve and is consistent with the patient's right-sided symptoms. The incidental finding of a left-sided nerve sheath tumor, such as a schwannoma or neurofibroma, does not appear to be related to the patient's symptoms but is an important finding that may require further evaluation. The other conditions listed are common causes of lower back pain and radiculopathy and remain in the differential diagnosis. A definitive diagnosis would likely involve correlating the clinical presentation with the imaging findings and may include further diagnostic tests or interventions.",90,Excellent
2019,Pituitary Abscess,"Based on the summary of the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03212019), we have a case of a 33-year-old woman brought in by family due to mental status changes over the past week. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Infectious meningitis or encephalitis
2. Autoimmune encephalopathy
3. Metabolic derangement (e.g., hepatic or renal encephalopathy)
4. Intracranial mass lesion (e.g., tumor, abscess)
5. Cerebrovascular event (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage)

Confidence Level: 60%

After reviewing the additional information provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03212019/tab-legends), which describes imaging findings of an enlarged pituitary gland that is centrally hypointense on non-contrast T1, with a thin peripheral rim of enhancement post-contrast, increased signal intensity on DWI, corresponding low ADC, and heterogeneous signal on coronal T2, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Pituitary adenoma with apoplexy
2. Pituitary macroadenoma with hemorrhagic or necrotic changes
3. Rathke's cleft cyst with hemorrhage
4. Lymphocytic hypophysitis
5. Metastasis to the pituitary gland

Confidence Level: 90%

The imaging findings suggest a pituitary lesion with characteristics of hemorrhage or necrosis, which is consistent with pituitary apoplexy or a macroadenoma with hemorrhagic/necrotic changes. Rathke's cleft cysts can also present with hemorrhage and mimic apoplexy. Lymphocytic hypophysitis and metastasis are less likely but should be considered given the acute presentation and imaging features. A definitive diagnosis would likely involve further endocrinological evaluation, possibly additional imaging, and potentially surgical intervention for histopathological confirmation.",90,Insufficient
2019,Post Laminectomy Gossypiboma,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01102019), a 44-year-old man with a history of surgical L4-L5 decompression for cauda equina syndrome presents with low back pain radiating to both lower limbs and has had urinary retention and incontinence for the last 2.5 months. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Recurrent disc herniation at the L4-L5 level
2. Epidural fibrosis or scar tissue post-surgery
3. Arachnoiditis
4. Spinal stenosis secondary to postoperative changes
5. Epidural abscess or hematoma

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the additional information provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01102019/tab-legends), which describes a well-defined, thick-walled lesion at the laminectomy site that is hyperdense on CT, with walls that are hypointense on T2-weighted images, hyperintense on T1-weighted images, and show enhancement after contrast administration without internal enhancement, as well as a large, extruded recurrent L4-L5 disc herniation causing severe canal stenosis and compression of the cauda equina roots, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Postoperative pseudomeningocele
2. Recurrent disc herniation with associated granulation tissue
3. Epidural abscess
4. Epidural hematoma
5. Neoplastic lesion (e.g., metastasis, primary spinal tumor)

Confidence Level: 85%

The imaging findings suggest a postoperative complication, with the lesion at the laminectomy site likely representing a pseudomeningocele, given its well-defined",85,Insufficient
2019,Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS) with adaptive compensatory functional changes,"Based on the summary of the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10102019), a 21-year-old man presents with gradual onset, slowly progressive, spastic weakness of his left upper/lower limbs over the last 2 years, with a normal laboratory workup including CSF, and no sensory deficit or ataxia by neurological examination. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Motor neuron disease (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis)
2. Cervical spondylotic myelopathy
3. Multiple sclerosis
4. Brain tumor affecting the motor cortex or pathways
5. Hereditary spastic paraplegia

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional information provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10102019/tab-legends), which describes imaging findings including focal volume loss and increased signal of the right precentral motor cortex, increased white matter signal of the right centrum semiovale, abnormal iron deposition in the right central sulcus, lower fractional anisotropy (FA) values of the right corticospinal tract, and exaggerated activation of the right hand motor area during bilateral finger tapping, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Focal cortical dysplasia
2. Rasmussen's encephalitis
3. Cortical-based tumor or low-grade glioma
4. Chronic infarct or ischemic changes in the motor cortex
5. Demyelinating disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis)

Confidence Level: 85%

The imaging findings suggest a focal cortical abnormality with associated white matter tract changes. Focal cortical dysplasia and Rasmussen's encephalitis are considerations given the focal nature of the cortical and subcortical findings. A cortical-based tumor or low-grade glioma could also present with progressive symptoms and imaging changes, although typically there might be more mass effect. Chronic infarct or ischemic changes could lead to volume loss and motor deficits, but the pattern of iron deposition is less typical. Demyelinating disease remains a possibility, although the findings are not classic for multiple sclerosis. Further evaluation, including a detailed clinical history, additional imaging, and possibly biopsy, would be necessary for a definitive diagnosis.",85,Insufficient
2019,Radiation-induced vasculopathy with pontine hematoma,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03282019), a 53-year-old man with a history of medulloblastoma surgically removed and subjected to radiation therapy at 18-months-old presents with sudden onset of difficulty in verbal articulation and muscle weakness of the left hemibody. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Recurrent medulloblastoma or late post-radiation neoplasm
2. Radiation-induced vasculopathy or stroke
3. Metastatic disease
4. Secondary malignancy due to previous radiation therapy (e.g., high-grade glioma)
5. Vascular event such as hemorrhage or ischemic stroke unrelated to radiation therapy

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the additional information provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03282019/tab-legends), which describes imaging findings of focal T1 hyperintensity of the pons with associated susceptibility indicating hematoma, multiple temporal and occipital microbleeds with sparing of the basal ganglia and thalami, and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) showing multiple focal stenoses in the posterior cerebral arteries (PCAs) and superior cerebellar arteries (SCAs) without involvement of the anterior circulation, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Radiation-induced vasculopathy leading to hemorrhage
2. Moyamoya disease or Moyamoya syndrome
3. Cryptogenic stroke with hemorrhagic transformation
4. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), although less likely given the sparing of the basal ganglia and thalami
5. Secondary vasculitis or inflammatory process

Confidence Level: 90%

The imaging findings and history of radiation therapy suggest a diagnosis of radiation-induced vasculopathy leading to hemorrhage. Moyamoya disease or syndrome is characterized by stenosis of the cerebral arteries and could be a consequence of radiation therapy. Cryptogenic stroke with hemorrhagic transformation is a possibility, but the multiple stenoses seen on DSA make a vasculopathy more likely. CAA typically involves the lobar regions and is associated with microbleeds, but the pattern of sparing the basal ganglia and thalami is atypical. Lastly, a secondary vasculitis or inflammatory process could also cause similar imaging findings but would be less common in this context. Further clinical correlation and possibly additional laboratory workup would be necessary to refine the diagnosis.",90,Excellent
2019,Remote supratentorial Hemorrhage,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06132019), a 56-year-old woman developed left eye ptosis and orthostatic headache on the 6th post-operative day after undergoing C2-T2 decompression surgery with posterior instrumental fusion for cervical myelopathy caused by ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak leading to intracranial hypotension
2. Postoperative hematoma causing mass effect or increased intracranial pressure
3. Meningitis or other postoperative infection
4. Carotid-cavernous fistula or other vascular injury
5. Tension pneumocephalus

Confidence Level: 80%

After reviewing the additional information provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06132019/tab-legends), which describes imaging findings of bilateral symmetrical convexal subarachnoid hemorrhage, bilateral posterior temporal lobe hematomas, bilateral small subdural hematomas along the bilateral temporoparietal convexities, a small subarachnoid clot in the quadrigeminal cistern, and no signs of dural or venous thrombosis on CT venography, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Postoperative convexal subarachnoid hemorrhage
2. Remote cerebellar hemorrhage
3. Postoperative subdural hematoma
4. Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS)
5. Secondary hemorrhage due to coagulopathy or anticoagulant use

Confidence Level: 90%

The imaging findings suggest a hemorrhagic complication following the surgical procedure. The presence of subarachnoid hemorrhage, particularly convexal, and subdural hematomas without evidence of venous thrombosis points towards a diagnosis of postoperative hemorrhage, which could be due to a variety of factors including surgical complications, RCVS, or a coagulopathy. Remote cerebellar hemorrhage is a known complication after spinal surgery, typically presenting with cerebellar bleeding, but the imaging findings in this case do not indicate cerebellar involvement. A definitive diagnosis would likely involve further clinical correlation, review of the surgical details, and possibly additional laboratory workup to assess for coagulopathy.",90,Good
2019,Ruptured Mycotic ICA Aneurysm with Invasive Sphenoid Sinusitis,"Based on the summary of the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09262019), a 73-year-old man presented with epistaxis, eye pain, and diplopia. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma
2. Sphenoid sinusitis with complications
3. Carotid-cavernous fistula
4. Orbital cellulitis or abscess
5. Invasive fungal sinusitis with orbital or intracranial extension

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional information provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09262019/tab-legends), which describes imaging findings of an internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm projecting into the opacified, enhancing right sphenoid sinus, with suspicion of a mycotic aneurysm due to the presence of infection/arteritis, and confirmation of Aspergillus fumigatus complex infection, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Mycotic aneurysm of the ICA secondary to Aspergillus infection
2. Invasive fungal sinusitis with vascular invasion
3. Carotid-cavernous fistula secondary to infection
4. Sphenoid sinusitis with secondary arterial erosion and aneurysm formation
5. Neoplastic process with secondary vascular involvement

Confidence Level: 95%

The imaging findings and clinical presentation, along with the culture results, strongly suggest a mycotic aneurysm of the ICA associated with an invasive fungal infection, specifically Aspergillus. The presence of an aneurysm extending through the eroded sinus wall and the irregularity of the ICA on DSA are indicative of a vascular infection. The other conditions listed are differential diagnoses that could present with similar symptoms but are less likely given the specific imaging findings and confirmed Aspergillus infection. A definitive diagnosis would involve a combination of imaging, clinical presentation, and microbiological evidence, as seen in this case.",95,Excellent

2. Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)
3. Sturge-Weber Syndrome
4. Encephalocraniocutaneous Lipomatosis (ECCL)
5. Goldenhar Syndrome

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the additional information provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11072019/tab-legends), which describes imaging findings of bilateral optic disc colobomas, arachnoid cysts, lipomas surrounding the trigeminal nerve and extending along its course through Meckelfs cave, evidence of left occipital polymicrogyria, and volume loss involving the left cerebral hemisphere with consequent dilation of the ipsilateral lateral ventricle, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Encephalocraniocutaneous Lipomatosis (ECCL)
2. Neurocutaneous syndromes with CNS lipomas (e.g., NF1 with CNS involvement)
3. Goldenhar Syndrome with associated CNS anomalies
4. Aicardi Syndrome
5. Congenital Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection with CNS sequelae

Confidence Level: 90%

The combination of cutaneous, ocular, and central nervous system findings, particularly the presence of optic disc colobomas, arachnoid cysts, and lipomas associated with the trigeminal nerve, is highly suggestive of Encephalocraniocutaneous Lipomatosis (ECCL). This rare neurocutaneous disorder is characterized by unilateral cutaneous, ocular, and neurological abnormalities. The other conditions listed are differential diagnoses that could present with similar symptoms but are less likely given the specific constellation of findings. A definitive diagnosis would likely involve a combination of clinical examination, imaging findings, and possibly genetic testing.",90,Insufficient
2019,Skull Anuerysmal Bone Cyst,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08082019), a 19-year-old man presents with a painful swelling on the top of his skull that has been growing rapidly in the last few weeks. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Osteosarcoma
2. Metastatic disease to the skull
3. Eosinophilic granuloma (Langerhans cell histiocytosis)
4. Aneurysmal bone cyst
5. Fibrous dysplasia

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional information provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08082019/tab-legends), which describes imaging findings of an expansile, right fronto-parietal bone lesion abutting the brain parenchyma with multiple cysts showing fluid-fluid levels and heterogeneous enhancement, and an arterial feeder from the superficial temporal artery on digital subtraction angiography, as well as a coexistent right sphenoidal fibrous dysplasia on PD MR imaging, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Aneurysmal bone cyst
2. Fibrous dysplasia with secondary aneurysmal bone cyst
3. Giant cell tumor
4. Osteosarcoma with cystic changes
5. Brown tumor of hyperparathyroidism

Confidence Level: 90%

The imaging characteristics of the lesion, particularly the presence of fluid-fluid levels and an arterial feeder, are highly suggestive of an aneurysmal bone cyst. The coexistence of fibrous dysplasia raises the possibility of a secondary aneurysmal bone cyst developing within a fibrous dysplasia lesion. Giant cell tumors can also present with similar imaging features, although they are less common in the skull. Osteosarcoma with cystic changes is a consideration given the rapid growth, but the presence of fluid-fluid levels is more typical of an aneurysmal bone cyst. Lastly, a Brown tumor should be considered in the context of hyperparathyroidism, although it is less likely given the imaging findings. A definitive diagnosis would likely involve further evaluation, including a biopsy for histopathological confirmation.",90,Excellent

After reviewing the additional information provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09052019/tab-legends), which describes imaging findings of multiple intramedullary high T2 lesions with subtle enhancement, no deposition of blood products, no bone remodeling, and histology showing clusters of isomorphic nuclei within a fine fibrillary background with micro cyst formation, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Ependymoma
2. Astrocytoma
3. Oligodendroglioma of the spinal cord
4. Ganglioglioma
5. Inflammatory/demyelinating disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis)

Confidence Level: 90%

The imaging and histological findings suggest a primary spinal cord neoplasm. Ependymomas and astrocytomas are common intramedullary tumors that can present with multiple lesions and subtle enhancement. Oligodendrogliomas and gangliogliomas are less common in the spinal cord but could present with similar histological features. The presence of multiple lesions also raises the possibility of an inflammatory or demyelinating process such as multiple sclerosis, although the histology would not typically show clusters of isomorphic nuclei with micro cyst formation. A definitive diagnosis would likely involve a combination of imaging findings, clinical presentation, and histopathological confirmation.",90,Good
2019,T2-FLAIR Mismatch in IDH-Mutated Glioma (Anaplastic Astrocytoma),"Based on the summary of the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11212019), we have a case involving a 49-year-old man with a first episode of seizure. However, the specific details necessary to list differential diagnoses are not included in the content summary. Therefore, I will list general differential diagnoses for a first seizure episode in a middle-aged adult:

1. Vascular event (e.g., stroke or transient ischemic attack)
2. Brain tumor (primary or metastatic)
3. Inflammatory or infectious process (e.g., encephalitis, meningitis)
4. Traumatic brain injury (recent or remote)
5. Metabolic or electrolyte imbalance (e.g., hypoglycemia, hyponatremia)

Confidence Level: 60% (This confidence level reflects the uncertainty due to the lack of specific clinical and imaging details that are typically required to refine a differential diagnosis list.)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11212019/tab-legends), we can revise the differential diagnoses based on the imaging characteristics of the lesion:

1. Low-grade glioma (e.g., astrocytoma) - typically shows hypointensity on FLAIR and no enhancement.
2. Cerebral infarction (chronic stage) - may show hypodensity on CT and hypoperfusion on rCBV map.
3. Demyelinating disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis) - can present with hyperintensity on T2WI and variable appearance on FLAIR.
4. Encephalomalacia due to old trauma or infarct - may not enhance and could show hypoperfusion.
5. Non-neoplastic cystic lesion (e.g., porencephalic cyst) - usually does not enhance and may have surrounding edema.

Confidence Level: 80% (This confidence level is higher due to the inclusion of specific imaging findings that help narrow down the differential diagnoses.)

Please note that the actual diagnosis would require correlation with the patient's clinical history, physical examination, and potentially further diagnostic tests. The confidence levels are subjective estimates based on the information provided and could vary with additional data.",80,Insufficient
2019,Tabes Dorsalis (Syphilitic Myelitis),"Based on the summary of the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10172019), we have a case involving a 22-year-old man with dysuria and numbness of the lower limbs who was later found to be HIV-positive. Without specific imaging findings, we can list general differential diagnoses for myelopathy in a young HIV-positive patient:

1. HIV-associated myelopathy
2. Infectious myelitis (e.g., viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic infection)
3. Inflammatory demyelinating diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis)
4. Vascular myelopathy (e.g., spinal cord infarction)
5. Compressive myelopathy (e.g., due to a spinal tumor or herniated disc)

Confidence Level: 50% (This confidence level reflects the broad nature of the differential diagnosis without specific imaging details.)

After reviewing the imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10172019/tab-legends), which describes a T1-weighted MRI with no obvious signal abnormality of the spinal cord, and a T2-weighted image showing long-segment high signal at the T4_6 level of the spinal cord with an inverted ""V"" sign, the differential diagnosis can be refined:

1. Transverse myelitis - can present with long-segment spinal cord signal changes on T2-weighted images.
2. Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) - often associated with longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions and may show an inverted ""V"" sign.
3. HIV myelopathy - typically presents with vacuolar myelopathy, which may not be apparent on T1-weighted images but could cause T2 signal changes.
4. Spinal cord lymphoma - can occur in immunocompromised patients and may present with T2 hyperintensity without significant changes on T1.
5. Infectious myelitis specific to HIV (e.g., cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus) - these infections can cause longitudinally extensive signal changes in the spinal cord.

Confidence Level: 70% (This confidence level is higher due to the inclusion of specific imaging findings that help narrow down the differential diagnoses. However, it is not 100% because the definitive diagnosis would require further clinical correlation and possibly additional investigations such as cerebrospinal fluid analysis or spinal cord biopsy.)",70,Insufficient
2019,Transient Global Amnesia,"Based on the content summary from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02072019), we have a case of a 57-year-old woman with acute onset of global amnesia, inability to communicate, and confusion, with symptoms resolving spontaneously the next day. Here are five differential diagnoses for transient global amnesia (TGA) and related symptoms:

1. Transient global amnesia (TGA)
2. Transient ischemic attack (TIA)
3. Seizure, particularly complex partial seizures or postictal state
4. Migraine with aura or complicated migraine
5. Metabolic disturbances (e.g., hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance)

Confidence Level: 70% (This confidence level reflects the typical presentation of TGA and other common conditions that can mimic its presentation.)

After reviewing the imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02072019/tab-legends), which describes diffusion-weighted MRI showing a tiny focus of restricted diffusion in the left lateral hippocampal body with corresponding low signal on ADC map and increased signal on FLAIR imaging, the differential diagnosis can be refined:

1. Transient global amnesia (TGA) - The imaging findings are consistent with the typical transient diffusion restriction seen in TGA.
2. Acute ischemic stroke - A tiny focus of restricted diffusion could represent a small acute infarct, although the rapid resolution is less typical.
3. Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) - Can cause temporal lobe changes, but typically more extensive and with a different clinical course.
4. Limbic encephalitis - May present with similar imaging findings but usually has a more protracted course.
5. Focal seizure with hippocampal involvement - Could explain the transient imaging findings and clinical symptoms.

Confidence Level: 90% (This confidence level is higher due to the specific imaging findings that are characteristic of TGA, which is the most likely diagnosis given the clinical presentation and rapid resolution of symptoms. However, it is not 100% because other rare conditions could potentially present with similar imaging findings.)",90,Excellent
2019,Trigeminal Schwannoma (V2 and V3),"Based on the content summary from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12052019), we have a case of a 39-year-old woman with progressive development of right proptosis. Here are five differential diagnoses for progressive proptosis:

1. Orbital tumor (e.g., orbital meningioma, schwannoma)
2. Thyroid eye disease (Graves' ophthalmopathy)
3. Orbital cellulitis/abscess
4. Orbital pseudotumor (idiopathic orbital inflammation)
5. Vascular lesion (e.g., carotid-cavernous fistula, orbital varix)

Confidence Level: 60% (This confidence level reflects the general nature of the differential diagnosis for proptosis without specific imaging details.)

After reviewing the imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12052019/tab-legends), which describes a fusiform right facial mass extending along V2 and V3 nerve branches with widening of the pterygopalatine fossa, heterogeneous enhancement of the solid parts of the lesion, cystic components, and expansive remodeling of the bony walls of the pterygopalatine fossa without aggressive features, the differential diagnosis can be refined:

1. Schwannoma (trigeminal schwannoma) - Typically presents as a fusiform mass along a nerve's course with cystic and solid components.
2. Meningioma - Can cause bony remodeling and extend along the nerve sheath, but usually has a dural attachment.
3. Fibrous dysplasia - Can cause bony remodeling and proptosis, but the presence of a soft tissue mass is less typical.
4. Invasive fungal sinusitis - Can cause bony changes and extend into the orbit, but typically appears more aggressive.
5. Benign fibro-osseous lesions (e.g., ossifying fibroma) - Can cause bony expansion and remodeling, but the involvement of the nerve branches would be atypical.

Confidence Level: 80% (This confidence level is higher due to the specific imaging findings that suggest a slow-growing, benign process involving the nerve branches. The lack of aggressive features points away from malignant or infectious processes. However, it is not 100% because the definitive diagnosis would require further clinical correlation and possibly additional investigations such as biopsy.)",80,Excellent
2019,Wernicke Encephalopathy after Bariatric Surgery,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12262019), a 19-year-old man presents with progressive headaches and visual symptoms over the last 8 days, following a sleeve gastrectomy performed 6 weeks prior. Here are five differential diagnoses for his presentation:

1. Post-surgical complications (e.g., venous thrombosis)
2. Nutritional deficiencies (e.g., vitamin B12 deficiency, Wernicke encephalopathy)
3. Intracranial hypertension (e.g., idiopathic intracranial hypertension)
4. Migraine with aura or complicated migraine
5. Space-occupying lesion (e.g., tumor, abscess)

Confidence Level: 65% (This confidence level reflects the consideration of common causes of headaches and visual symptoms in a young patient, taking into account the recent surgery which could contribute to complications or nutritional deficiencies.)

After reviewing the imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12262019/tab-legends), which describes T2-FLAIR images showing hyperintensities in medial thalamic regions, periaqueductal gray, and superior and inferior colliculi, DWI showing hyperintensities with normal ADC values, and gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images showing enhancement of the lesions, the differential diagnosis can be refined:

1. Wernicke encephalopathy - Classically associated with thalamic and periaqueductal gray matter changes, often related to nutritional deficiencies such as thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency.
2. Central nervous system (CNS) infection (e.g., encephalitis, including viral or bacterial)
3. Demyelinating disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis)
4. Lymphoma or other CNS neoplasms - Can show enhancement but would be less likely to present with this specific pattern of involvement.
5. Paraneoplastic or autoimmune encephalitis - Can present with similar imaging findings but would typically have additional clinical features.

Confidence Level: 85% (This confidence level is higher due to the specific imaging findings that are suggestive of Wernicke encephalopathy, which is a strong consideration given the patient's recent history of bariatric surgery and the associated risk of nutritional deficiencies. However, it is not 100% because other conditions could potentially present with similar imaging findings, and further clinical correlation and laboratory testing are necessary for a definitive diagnosis.)",85,Excellent
2019,gWhiteh epidermoid cyst,"Based on the content summary from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04112019), we have a case of a 38-year-old patient with a right-sided sixth cranial nerve palsy. Here are five differential diagnoses for sixth cranial nerve palsy:

1. Microvascular ischemic cranial neuropathy (often associated with diabetes or hypertension)
2. Neoplasm compressing the sixth cranial nerve (e.g., meningioma, metastasis)
3. Inflammatory conditions (e.g., multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis)
4. Basilar skull fracture involving the clivus or petrous apex
5. Raised intracranial pressure (e.g., idiopathic intracranial hypertension, brain tumor)

Confidence Level: 60% (This confidence level reflects the general nature of the differential diagnosis for sixth cranial nerve palsy without specific imaging details.)

After reviewing the imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04112019/tab-legends), which describes a T1 bright lesion that does not enhance, is T2 dark, and shows restricted diffusion from the pontomedullary junction to C2, the differential diagnosis can be refined:

1. Epidermoid cyst - Characteristically bright on T1, dark on T2, and may show restricted diffusion.
2. Lipoma - Typically bright on T1 and may not enhance, but usually does not show restricted diffusion.
3. Neuroenteric cyst - Can be T1 bright and T2 variable, but enhancement and diffusion characteristics can vary.
4. Focal myelitis or glioma - Could present with restricted diffusion, but the T1 and T2 characteristics are not typical.
5. Ischemic stroke - Acute infarction can show restricted diffusion, but the T1 brightness and lack of enhancement are atypical.

Confidence Level: 80% (This confidence level is higher due to the specific imaging findings that are suggestive of an epidermoid cyst, which is a strong consideration given the T1 and T2 characteristics and the pattern of restricted diffusion. However, it is not 100% because other rare conditions could potentially present with similar imaging findings, and further clinical correlation and possibly additional investigations such as biopsy would be necessary for a definitive diagnosis.)",80,Excellent
2018,Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma with Perineural Spread,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02152018), we have a case of a 72-year-old man with a 4-month history of progressive nasogenian hypoesthesia and infraorbital pain. Here are five differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Trigeminal neuralgia
2. Maxillary sinusitis
3. Neoplastic processes (e.g., schwannoma or other nerve sheath tumors)
4. Infectious processes (e.g., herpes zoster)
5. Vascular lesions (e.g., aneurysm affecting the trigeminal nerve branches)

Confidence Level: 60%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02152018/tab-legends), which describes a fusiform enlargement of the left infraorbital nerve with intense homogeneous enhancement and involvement of the pterygopalatine fossa, foramen rotundum, and cavernous sinus, as well as an enhancing mucosal palatine lesion involving the hard and soft palate corresponding to the primary tumor, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Perineural spread of a malignant tumor (given the primary palatine lesion and contiguous spread)
2. Schwannoma or neurofibroma with secondary changes
3. Inflammatory pseudotumor (less likely given the intense homogeneous enhancement and contiguous spread)
4. Lymphoma (can have perineural spread, though less common)
5. Metastatic disease with perineural invasion

Confidence Level: 85%

The presence of a primary tumor involving the palatine nerve area and the contiguous masticator space, along with the described imaging features, strongly suggests a neoplastic process with perineural spread, which should be the primary consideration in this case. Further clinical correlation, biopsy, and histopathological examination would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",85,Excellent
2018,Ameloblastic fibro-odontoma (AFO),"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12132018), we have a case of a 5-year-old girl with a non-painful ""curving"" in her mandible that has been enlarging over the past 2 weeks. Here are five differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Odontogenic cyst or tumor (e.g., dentigerous cyst, ameloblastoma)
2. Fibrous dysplasia
3. Ossifying fibroma
4. Central giant cell granuloma
5. Eosinophilic granuloma (part of the Langerhans cell histiocytosis spectrum)

Confidence Level: 50%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12132018/tab-legends), which describes a large, expansile mass centered in the anterior mandible with large areas of osseous dehiscence and protrusion into the premandibular tissues, the mass being isodense relative to muscle, eroding the mandibular ridge, and containing multiple teeth, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Ameloblastic fibroma or ameloblastoma (given the presence of multiple teeth and expansile nature)
2. Odontoma (complex odontoma could present with a mass containing multiple teeth)
3. Central giant cell granuloma (can be expansile but less likely to contain teeth)
4. Myxoma (though typically does not contain teeth)
5. Fibrous dysplasia (less likely given the presence of teeth within the lesion)

Confidence Level: 75%

The presence of multiple teeth within the lesion and the expansile growth pattern are characteristic of odontogenic tumors, making ameloblastic fibroma or ameloblastoma and odontoma strong considerations. The final diagnosis would require correlation with clinical findings, and possibly biopsy and histopathological examination to confirm the diagnosis.",75,Excellent
2018,Astroblastoma,"Based on the summary of the content from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11222018), we have a case of a 5-year-old girl with a 2-month history of progressive headache, dyskinesia, nausea, vomiting, and one episode of seizures. Here are five differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Primary brain tumor (e.g., astrocytoma, medulloblastoma)
2. Infectious or post-infectious process (e.g., brain abscess, encephalitis)
3. Inflammatory disease (e.g., acute disseminated encephalomyelitis)
4. Vascular malformation (e.g., arteriovenous malformation with hemorrhage)
5. Metabolic disorder (e.g., mitochondrial disorder, urea cycle disorder)

Confidence Level: 60%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11222018/tab-legends), which describes a heterogeneous solid and cystic lesion centered in the right temporal lobe with low signal in T1, high signal in T2 and FLAIR, associated with vasogenic edema, and the solid portion showing contrast enhancement and restricted diffusion, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Low-grade glioma (e.g., pilocytic astrocytoma, which can present with cystic and solid components)
2. Ganglioglioma (can present with a similar imaging appearance and may cause seizures)
3. Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET, often associated with seizures and a temporal lobe location)
4. PNET/Primitive neuroectodermal tumor (less likely given the imaging characteristics)
5. Infectious or inflammatory process with a dominant lesion (e.g., cerebral abscess, though less likely given the enhancement pattern)

Confidence Level: 80%

The imaging characteristics of a cystic and solid lesion with enhancement and restricted diffusion in a child with seizures and neurological symptoms suggest a neoplastic process, with low-grade glioma and ganglioglioma being strong considerations. The final diagnosis would require further clinical correlation, and possibly biopsy and histopathological examination to confirm the diagnosis.",80,Insufficient
2018,Atypical Dermoid Cyst,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03152018), we have a case of a 30-year-old woman with a history of transient blackouts for 1 year and one episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizures a month ago.

1. Meningioma
2. Glioma
3. Metastatic brain lesion

5. Epileptogenic cortical dysplasia

Confidence Level: 60%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03152018/tab-legends), which describes a homogenous hyperdense lesion with a peripheral mural nodule with calcification in the left frontal region, and the lesion having a cystic component that is isointense on T1-weighted imaging, homogenously hypointense on T2-weighted imaging, with an enhancing mural nodule and no diffusion restriction, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Meningioma (given the presence of a calcified nodule and enhancement)
2. Oligodendroglioma (can present with calcification and cystic components)
3. Pilocytic astrocytoma (especially with a cystic component and enhancing mural nodule)
4. Ganglioglioma (can present with seizures and a cystic lesion with an enhancing nodule)
5. Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) (known to present with seizures and cystic lesions with enhancing mural nodules)

Confidence Level: 80%

The imaging characteristics of a hyperdense lesion with calcification and a cystic component with an enhancing mural nodule are suggestive of a neoplastic process, with meningioma being a strong consideration due to the calcification and enhancement pattern. However, the presence of seizures and the specific imaging features also raise the possibility of a glial or glioneuronal tumor. The final diagnosis would require further clinical correlation, and possibly biopsy and histopathological examination to confirm the diagnosis.",80,Insufficient
2018,Basal Ganglia Stroke in Child Following Mild Head Trauma,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05102018), we have a case of a 2-year-old girl with a history of a 2-foot fall at night, difficulty standing the next morning, and paucity of movements of the right upper and lower limbs on examination. Here are five differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Traumatic brain injury with contusion or hemorrhage
2. Acute ischemic stroke
3. Intracranial hemorrhage (e.g., subdural, epidural, or intraparenchymal)
4. Post-traumatic seizure or Todd's paralysis
5. Cerebral edema secondary to trauma

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05102018/tab-legends), which describes a small hyperdense speck in the left striatocapsular region on CT, a linear, vertically oriented hyperdensity corresponding with the orientation of lenticulostriate arteries, diffusion restriction in the left caudate and lentiform nuclei on DWI, and no major vascular abnormality on MRA, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Lacunar infarct (given the location and pattern of diffusion restriction)
2. Small vessel disease (e.g., vasculitis, moyamoya disease, although less likely without vascular abnormality on MRA)
3. Cerebral microbleeds (could explain the hyperdense speck on CT)
4. Post-traumatic ischemia (secondary to the fall, although typically would not have such a well-defined vascular territory involvement)
5. Hemiplegic migraine (rare in this age group and would not typically show diffusion restriction)

Confidence Level: 85%

The imaging findings suggest a vascular event, most likely a lacunar infarct, given the pattern of diffusion restriction and the absence of major vascular abnormalities on MRA. The presence of a hyperdense speck could represent a small hemorrhage or calcification, which is less typical for a lacunar stroke but could be seen in the context of cerebral microbleeds or other small vessel pathologies. The final diagnosis would require further clinical correlation and possibly additional imaging or laboratory studies to assess for underlying vascular or coagulation disorders.",85,Excellent
2018,Carotid Cavernous Sinus Dural Fistula,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05172018), we have a case of a 36-year-old woman with a history of diplopia that resolved upon correction of hyperglycemia; 1 month later, she developed exophthalmos, chemosis, and blurred vision, with physical examination revealing ophthalmoplegia without vision loss. Here are five differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Thyroid eye disease (Graves' ophthalmopathy)
2. Orbital cellulitis
3. Carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF)
4. Orbital pseudotumor (idiopathic orbital inflammation)
5. Orbital neoplasm (e.g., lymphoma, metastatic disease)

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05172018/tab-legends), which describes abnormal opacification and enlargement of the superior ophthalmic vein with associated proptosis, early venous opacification of the cavernous sinus draining through the ophthalmic vein and the inferior petrosal sinus, and normalization of the congestive scleral veins post-transvenous endovascular treatment, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF) (given the abnormal vascular findings and response to treatment)
2. Orbital venous malformation (less likely given the response to endovascular treatment)
3. Dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) involving the cavernous sinus (similar presentation to CCF)
4. Thrombosis of the cavernous sinus or superior ophthalmic vein (less likely given the early venous opacification)
5. Neoplastic processes causing secondary vascular changes (e.g., lymphoma, metastasis, but less likely given the imaging and clinical improvement post-treatment)

Confidence Level: 90%

The imaging findings and clinical presentation are highly suggestive of a vascular abnormality, with a carotid-cavernous fistula being the most likely diagnosis. The early venous opacification and enlargement of the superior ophthalmic vein are characteristic of CCF, and the improvement after endovascular treatment further supports this diagnosis. The final diagnosis would be confirmed by the clinical response to treatment and further angiographic studies if needed.",90,Excellent
2018,Central Neurocytoma,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09272018), we have a case of a 20-year-old woman with progressive headache. Here are five differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

2. Intracranial mass lesion (e.g., brain tumor)
3. Intracranial hemorrhage (e.g., subarachnoid hemorrhage)
4. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri)
5. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis

Confidence Level: 50%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second content summary (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09272018/tab-legends), which describes a heterogeneous expansive lesion in the lateral ventricles arising from the septum pellucidum, with hydrocephalus, extension to the third ventricle, suprasellar and superior cerebellar cistern, and through the cerebral aqueduct, as well as multiple low signal areas on SWAN and irregular enhancement on postcontrast T1WI, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Central neurocytoma (commonly arises in the septum pellucidum and can cause hydrocephalus)
2. Colloid cyst (can arise in the third ventricle and cause obstructive hydrocephalus)
3. Subependymoma (typically found in ventricular system and may have heterogeneous signal)
4. Ependymoma (arises from ependymal cells lining the ventricles and can cause hydrocephalus)
5. Astrocytoma (including low-grade astrocytoma or glioblastoma with ventricular involvement)

Confidence Level: 80%

The imaging characteristics of a heterogeneous expansive lesion in the ventricular system with hydrocephalus and irregular enhancement suggest a neoplastic process. Central neurocytoma and ependymoma are strong considerations given the location and imaging features. The final diagnosis would require further clinical correlation, and possibly biopsy and histopathological examination to confirm the diagnosis.",80,Excellent
2018,Cerebral Hyperperfusion Syndrome,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03082018), we have a case of a 76-year-old man with myoclonus of the left upper limb, floating left hemiparesis, and altered state of consciousness. The patient had undergone a carotid endarterectomy 7 days before the onset of symptoms. Here are five differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Cerebral ischemia or stroke
2. Hyperperfusion syndrome post-carotid endarterectomy
3. Intracranial hemorrhage
4. Seizure activity post-surgery
5. Carotid artery dissection or thrombosis

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second content summary (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03082018/tab-legends), which describes mild chronic angiopathic changes on FLAIR, no evidence of restricted diffusion on DWI, increased cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the right hemisphere, and prolonged mean transit time (MTT) in the right hemisphere, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Hyperperfusion syndrome post-carotid endarterectomy (increased CBF and prolonged MTT are consistent with this diagnosis)
2. Cerebral ischemia or stroke (although no restricted diffusion, the symptoms and recent surgery raise this possibility)
3. Seizure activity post-surgery (could explain myoclonus and altered consciousness, but less likely given imaging findings)
4. Intracranial hemorrhage (no evidence on DWI, but clinical symptoms could suggest this)
5. Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) (possible after carotid surgery, but imaging does not show typical ischemic changes)

Confidence Level: 85%

The imaging findings of increased CBF and prolonged MTT in the right hemisphere, particularly after carotid endarterectomy, are suggestive of hyperperfusion syndrome, which can occur as a complication of the surgery. The absence of restricted diffusion makes acute ischemia less likely, and the clinical presentation is consistent with hyperperfusion syndrome. The final diagnosis would require further clinical correlation and possibly additional imaging or monitoring to assess hemodynamic changes and guide management.",85,Excellent
2018,Cerebral Malaria,"Based on the content provided, we have a case of a 41-year-old woman on HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) with fever and seizures before entering a coma after recent travel to Uganda. Here are five differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Central nervous system (CNS) opportunistic infections (e.g., toxoplasmosis, cryptococcosis)
2. CNS lymphoma
3. Cerebral malaria
4. Tuberculous meningitis or CNS tuberculosis
5. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second content summary (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07262018/tab-legends), which describes axial SWI showing susceptibility within the basal ganglia bilaterally, axial T1 postgadolinium showing multiple areas of subcortical enhancement, axial FLAIR showing ill-defined high signal intensity within the right periventricular white matter, increased signal intensity in the globus pallidi bilaterally, and focal enhancement in the same regions, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Cerebral toxoplasmosis (common opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients, can show ring-enhancing lesions)
2. Primary CNS lymphoma (can present with focal lesions and enhancement in immunocompromised patients)
3. Cerebral malaria (endemic in Uganda, can cause cerebral edema and petechial hemorrhages)
4. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) (post-infectious inflammatory condition, can show multifocal white matter lesions)
5. Neurocysticercosis (parasitic infection, can show cystic lesions and calcifications)

Confidence Level: 85%

The imaging findings of susceptibility within the basal ganglia, subcortical enhancement, and high signal intensity in the periventricular white matter suggest an infectious or inflammatory process. Given the patient's immunocompromised status (on HAART) and recent travel to Uganda, opportunistic infections such as cerebral toxoplasmosis and cerebral malaria are strong considerations.

2. Aicardi syndrome - typically presents with agenesis of the corpus callosum, chorioretinal lacunae, and infantile spasms, but is usually seen in females.
3. Holoprosencephaly - a condition where the brain fails to divide into two hemispheres; associated with midline facial anomalies and can include agenesis of the septum pellucidum.
4. Dandy-Walker malformation - characterized by an enlarged fourth ventricle and a hypoplastic or absent cerebellar vermis, sometimes associated with other midline brain anomalies.
5. Chiari malformation - a condition where brain tissue extends into the spinal canal, which may be associated with other neural tube defects.

Confidence level: 70%

After reviewing the additional information from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12202018/tab-legends), which describes a non-contrast multiplanar cervical spine MRI showing a dorsal linear defect at C3 with a tract to the skin and mild posterior traction of the spinal cord without abnormal spinal cord signal, the differential diagnoses should be revised to consider spinal anomalies:

1. Dermal sinus tract - a congenital condition where a tract extends from the skin surface to deeper structures, sometimes to the spinal cord, which can cause tethering.
2. Spinal cord tethering - a condition where the spinal cord is abnormally attached, which can cause traction and neurological symptoms.
3. Diastematomyelia - a split spinal cord condition, which can present with midline cutaneous anomalies.
4. Meningocele - a type of spina bifida where the meninges protrude through a vertebral defect, potentially with a tract leading to the skin.
5. Lipomyelomeningocele - a form of spina bifida where fat attaches to the spinal cord and can cause tethering, often associated with a skin dimple or other cutaneous marker.

Confidence level: 90%

The presence of a tract leading to the skin and the specific spinal cord findings significantly increase the likelihood of a diagnosis related to a spinal dermal anomaly, such as a dermal sinus tract or tethered spinal cord.",90,Excellent
2018,Choroid Plexus Infarction,"Based on the case description provided from the external link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06142018), a 17-year-old adolescent girl presented with acute onset of drowsiness, dysarthria, left palpebral ptosis, and headache following lung surgery. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Postoperative cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) - a potential complication after surgery, leading to neurological symptoms.
2. Postoperative infection leading to meningitis or encephalitis - which can present with headache, altered mental status, and focal neurological signs.
3. Iatrogenic stroke - a cerebrovascular accident related to the surgery, potentially due to embolism or hypoperfusion.
4. Myasthenic crisis - which can cause ptosis and dysarthria, potentially triggered by the stress of surgery.
5. Medication-induced encephalopathy - side effects or interactions of medications used during or after surgery.

Confidence level: 65%

After reviewing the additional information from the diagram description provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06142018/tab-legends), which includes MRI findings of focal diffusion restriction in the left medial thalamus and ipsilateral choroid plexus with low ADC values, and focal left choroid plexus swelling, the differential diagnoses should be revised to consider conditions that can cause these specific imaging findings:

1. Thalamic stroke - ischemic stroke can cause diffusion restriction and corresponding low ADC values in the thalamus.
2. Choroid plexitis - inflammation of the choroid plexus could explain the swelling and diffusion restriction.
3. Infectious encephalitis - certain infections can lead to focal brain swelling and diffusion restriction.
4. Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis - associated with malignancy and can cause focal neurological deficits and MRI changes.
5. Autoimmune encephalitis - can present with acute neurological symptoms and may show focal MRI changes.

Confidence level: 85%

The MRI findings suggest a focal process affecting the thalamus and choroid plexus, which is more characteristic of an ischemic or inflammatory condition rather than a generalized postoperative complication. The presence of diffusion restriction with low ADC values is indicative of cytotoxic edema, which is commonly seen in acute ischemic stroke but can also be present in certain inflammatory or infectious processes. The follow-up MRI showing normalization of the choroid plexus signal is also an important consideration in refining the differential diagnosis.",85,Excellent
2018,Complete Carotid Artery Agenesis,"Based on the content summary from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04192018), a 68-year-old man presented with a presyncopal episode followed by generalized weakness. Without additional clinical details or imaging findings, here are five initial differential diagnoses that could be considered:

1. Transient ischemic attack (TIA) - temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain, causing symptoms like presyncope and weakness.
2. Stroke - a cerebrovascular event that can lead to sudden neurological deficits.
3. Cardiac arrhythmia - irregular heartbeats can lead to reduced cerebral perfusion and presyncopal episodes.
4. Orthostatic hypotension - a drop in blood pressure upon standing that can cause dizziness and weakness.
5. Seizure - a neurological event that can present with transient neurological symptoms and postictal weakness.

Confidence level: 50%

After reviewing the additional information from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04192018/tab-legends), which describes imaging findings including the absence of the left internal carotid canal and left common, internal, and external carotid arteries, as well as a compensatory prominent anterior communicating artery and collateral circulation, the differential diagnoses should be revised to consider conditions related to these vascular anomalies:

1. Congenital absence of the internal carotid artery - a rare vascular anomaly that may be asymptomatic or present with neurological symptoms due to compromised cerebral blood flow.
2. Moyamoya disease - a condition characterized by stenosis or occlusion at the ends of the internal carotid arteries and an abnormal network of collateral vessels.
3. Atherosclerotic carotid artery disease - although typically not leading to complete absence, it can cause significant stenosis and lead to cerebral ischemia.
4. Fibromuscular dysplasia - a non-atherosclerotic, non-inflammatory disease of the blood vessels that can cause stenosis, aneurysms, or occlusions.
5. Collateral vessel formation secondary to chronic large vessel occlusion - which could be due to a variety of causes, including trauma, dissection, or other vascular pathologies.

Confidence level: 90%

The imaging findings strongly suggest a congenital or long-standing vascular anomaly with compensatory collateral circulation, which is consistent with the congenital absence of the internal carotid artery. The presence of a prominent anterior communicating artery and external carotid artery (ECA) to ECA anastomosis supports the body's adaptation to the absent carotid circulation.",90,Excellent
2018,Delayed Posthypoxic Leukoencephalopathy,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01042018), a 40-year-old man presented with somnolence, mutism, and altered behavior after recovering from a toxic coma one month prior. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Post-anoxic encephalopathy - brain damage due to a lack of oxygen, possibly related to the recent toxic coma.
2. Toxic/metabolic encephalopathy - ongoing or additional exposure to a toxic substance or metabolic derangement.
3. Diffuse axonal injury - widespread injury to the brain's white matter, which could be a sequela of the coma.
4. Central pontine myelinolysis - a demyelinating condition that can occur after rapid correction of hyponatremia, potentially related to the patient's recent medical history.
5. Autoimmune encephalitis - an inflammatory brain disease that can present with rapid onset of altered mental status and behavioral changes.

Confidence level: 60%

After reviewing the additional information from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01042018/tab-legends), which describes MRI findings of symmetric high intensity in subcortical white matter on FLAIR images, symmetric diffusion restriction on DWI, and an increase in hyperintensity on FLAIR and DWI two weeks later without restriction on the ADC map, the differential diagnoses should be revised to consider conditions that can cause these specific imaging findings:

1. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) - an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, often post-infectious or post-vaccination.
2. Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter - a genetic condition that can present with rapid deterioration following febrile episodes or minor head trauma.
3. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) - a demyelinating disease caused by the JC virus, typically seen in immunocompromised patients.
4. Toxic leukoencephalopathy - white matter damage due to exposure to toxic agents, which could be related to the patient's toxic coma.
5. Mitochondrial encephalopathy - a group of disorders caused by dysfunction of the mitochondria, with possible white matter changes on MRI.

Confidence level: 80%

The MRI findings suggest a process affecting the white matter with a dynamic course, as indicated by the changes over two weeks. The absence of diffusion restriction on the ADC map two weeks later suggests that the process may be reversible or inflammatory rather than ischemic.",80,Excellent
2018,Embryonal Tumor with Multilayered Rosettes (ETMR),"Based on the initial case description provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07192018), a 3-year-old girl experienced focal left limb shaking that generalized to a tonic-clonic seizure which self-terminated after 20 minutes. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Focal epilepsy - due to an underlying structural brain abnormality or idiopathic.
2. Febrile seizure - common in children, especially if associated with a recent history of fever.
3. Central nervous system infection - such as meningitis or encephalitis, which can present with seizures.
4. Electrolyte imbalance - such as hyponatremia or hypocalcemia, which can cause seizures.
5. Brain tumor - a mass lesion in the brain can present with seizures due to irritation of the surrounding brain tissue.

Confidence level: 60%

After reviewing the additional information from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07192018/tab-legends), which describes MRI findings of a well-defined, hyperintense lesion in the superior right parietal lobule on T2WI and FLAIR with no perilesional edema, intra-axial location, homogeneous restricted diffusion with low ADC values, and no associated enhancement on postcontrast T1WI, the differential diagnoses should be revised to consider conditions that can cause these specific imaging findings:

1. Cerebral abscess - typically shows ring-enhancing lesions with restricted diffusion, but can sometimes present without enhancement in early stages.
2. Low-grade glioma - such as pilocytic astrocytoma, which can present with seizures and may show a well-defined lesion with variable enhancement.
3. Cerebral infarction - an ischemic stroke can cause restricted diffusion, although it is less common in this age group without a predisposing condition.
4. Encephalitis - inflammation of the brain, which can present with seizures and focal MRI changes.
5. Demyelinating disease - such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), which can present with seizures and focal hyperintense lesions on MRI.

Confidence level: 80%

The MRI findings suggest a focal lesion with restricted diffusion, which is more characteristic of a cerebral abscess or a high-cellularity tumor, such as a high-grade glioma or lymphoma. However, the lack of enhancement is atypical for these conditions. The absence of perilesional edema and the well-defined nature of the lesion may be more suggestive of a low-grade glioma or a non-neoplastic process. The diagnosis in such a case would be challenging and would likely require further investigation, including potentially biopsy, to ascertain the nature of the lesion.",80,Insufficient
2018,Giant cell arteritis,"Based on the content summary from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09062018), a 76-year-old woman presented with a history of sudden headache, recent onset limb claudication, and mobility limitation. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Giant cell arteritis (GCA) - an inflammatory disease of blood vessels that can cause headache and jaw claudication, which may be associated with limb claudication.
2. Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) - a systemic vasculitis that can affect medium-sized arteries, leading to symptoms like claudication.
3. Stroke - a cerebrovascular event that can present with sudden headache and mobility issues.
4. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) - which can cause limb claudication and mobility problems due to atherosclerotic blockages.
5. Cervical spine stenosis - which can cause mobility limitation and, in some cases, headaches.

Confidence level: 70%

After reviewing the additional information from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09062018/tab-legends), which describes imaging findings including a filling defect within the V3 segment of the right vertebral artery consistent with thrombus, left vertebral artery wall thickening and stenosis with a beaded pattern, and increased uptake of the abdominal aortic wall and both vertebral and femoral arteries on 18FDG-PET, the differential diagnoses should be revised to consider conditions that can cause these specific imaging findings:

1. Giant cell arteritis (GCA) - the imaging findings are consistent with vasculitis, and GCA is a common form of large-vessel vasculitis in the elderly.
2. Takayasu arteritis - another form of large-vessel vasculitis, though less common in this age group compared to GCA.
3. Atherosclerosis with thrombosis - can cause stenosis and thrombus formation, but the beaded pattern and PET findings suggest an inflammatory process.
4. Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease) - a non-atherosclerotic, inflammatory vascular disease, though it typically affects younger smokers.
5. Infection-related vasculitis - such as from syphilis or other infections, which can cause vessel wall inflammation and stenosis.

Confidence level: 90%

The combination of imaging findings, including the beaded pattern on CT angiography and increased uptake on 18FDG-PET, strongly suggests a vasculitis, with GCA being the most likely given the patient's age and the involvement of large vessels. The sudden headache and limb claudication are also clinical features that support this diagnosis.",90,Excellent
2018,Glioblastoma involving the optic nerve,"Based on the case description provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10252018), a 67-year-old woman presented with progressive, left-sided vision loss associated with ocular pain and headaches. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Optic neuritis - inflammation of the optic nerve, often associated with pain and vision loss.
2. Ischemic optic neuropathy - caused by reduced blood flow to the optic nerve, leading to vision loss.
3. Glaucoma - increased intraocular pressure causing optic nerve damage, pain, and vision loss.
4. Ocular migraine - can cause visual disturbances and headache, though typically not progressive vision loss.
5. Pituitary adenoma - a tumor that can compress the optic chiasm and lead to vision changes and headache.

Confidence level: 70%

After reviewing the additional information from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10252018/tab-legends), which describes MRI findings of a hyperintense lesion enlarging the left optic nerve and chiasm, along with an infiltrative, non-enhancing, mildly expansile cortical and subcortical high T2 lesion in the right frontal lobe, and postcontrast images showing avid enhancement of the left optic nerve lesion with a focal area of necrosis and enhancement along the left optic nerve sheath, the differential diagnoses should be revised to consider conditions that can cause these specific imaging findings:

1. Optic nerve glioma - a tumor that can cause enlargement and enhancement of the optic nerve and chiasm, often associated with neurofibromatosis type 1.
2. Meningioma - a tumor that can involve the optic nerve sheath and cause enhancement and enlargement.
3. Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) - can present with infiltrative lesions and postcontrast enhancement, though necrosis is less common.
4. Metastatic disease - can cause multiple lesions with variable enhancement patterns, including involvement of the optic nerve.
5. Sarcoidosis - a granulomatous disease that can affect the central nervous system and optic nerve, leading to enhancement and enlargement.

Confidence level: 85%

The presence of an enhancing lesion of the optic nerve with associated necrosis and a separate infiltrative brain lesion raises the suspicion for a neoplastic process, with optic nerve glioma and meningioma being strong considerations. The differential diagnosis would benefit from additional clinical information, such as the presence of neurofibromatosis or other systemic symptoms, and may require further investigation, including biopsy, to reach a definitive diagnosis.",85,Good
2018,Hemorrhagic Vestibular Schwannoma,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07122018), a 60-year-old man presented with right hemifacial hypoesthesia for 3 months. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Trigeminal schwannoma - a benign tumor of the nerve sheath that can cause facial numbness.
2. Meningioma - a common benign tumor that can compress cranial nerves and cause hypoesthesia.
3. Metastatic lesion - a secondary tumor that can affect the cerebellopontine angle and impact cranial nerve function.
4. Acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma) - a benign tumor that can cause facial numbness if it compresses the trigeminal nerve.
5. Multiple sclerosis (MS) - a demyelinating disease that can present with cranial nerve symptoms, including facial numbness.

Confidence level: 70%

After reviewing the additional information from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07122018/tab-legends), which describes MRI findings of a predominantly cystic extra-axial lesion with a fluid-fluid level in the right cerebellopontine angle cistern and internal auditory canal, high T1 and low T2 signal consistent with hemorrhage, and enhancement of the solid portion with mass effect over the brain stem and cerebellar peduncles, the differential diagnoses should be revised to consider conditions that can cause these specific imaging findings:

1. Hemorrhagic vestibular schwannoma - the presence of hemorrhage within a cystic lesion is characteristic of a schwannoma that has bled.
2. Meningioma with hemorrhage - meningiomas can occasionally bleed, leading to fluid-fluid levels.
3. Epidermoid cyst with hemorrhage - these benign lesions can rarely bleed, and they typically occur in the cerebellopontine angle.
4. Metastatic lesion with hemorrhage - metastases can bleed, especially from primary tumors known to be hemorrhagic like melanoma or renal cell carcinoma.
5. Paraganglioma (glomus tumor) - these vascular tumors can present with hemorrhage and are often located in the cerebellopontine angle.

Confidence level: 85%

The imaging findings suggest a lesion with both cystic and solid components, with evidence of hemorrhage and enhancement, which is most consistent with a hemorrhagic vestibular schwannoma. However, other hemorrhagic lesions in the cerebellopontine angle should also be considered. Further clinical correlation and possibly additional imaging or biopsy may be required for a definitive diagnosis.",85,Excellent
2018,High CBV due to Developmental Venous Anomaly (DVA),"Based on the summary of the content provided from the first link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02222018, we have a case involving a 69-year-old man with acute onset of left-sided weakness and left-arm myoclonus, with symptoms remitting during his hospital stay. Without specific imaging findings or additional clinical details, we can propose a broad range of differential diagnoses for these symptoms:

1. Ischemic stroke
2. Transient ischemic attack (TIA)
3. Seizure with postictal paralysis (Todd's paralysis)
4. Intracranial hemorrhage
5. Space-occupying lesion (e.g., tumor, abscess)

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02222018/tab-legends, which describes serpiginous enhancement in the right frontal lobe on axial and sagittal CTA images, and increased relative cerebral blood volume (CBV), time to peak (TTP), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and mean transit time (MTT) in the right frontoparietal region on CT perfusion images, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) or fistula
2. High-grade glioma with increased vascularity
3. Metastatic disease with a hypervascular primary tumor
4. Cerebral abscess with surrounding vasogenic edema
5. Inflammatory/demyelinating process such as multiple sclerosis (less likely given the patient's age and acute presentation)

The presence of serpiginous enhancement and altered perfusion metrics suggests a vascular abnormality or a highly vascularized lesion, which would make options like AVM or a vascular tumor more likely.

Confidence Level: 85%

Please note that the actual diagnosis would require a comprehensive review of the full clinical picture, including patient history, examination findings, and a detailed assessment of the imaging. The confidence levels provided are based on the limited information available and are intended to reflect the likelihood of the differential diagnoses given the typical presentation of such cases in neuroradiology.",85,Insufficient
2018,Hunter Syndrome,"Based on the summary of the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08022018, the patient is a 21-year-old man presenting with a headache. The imaging findings include:

- Nonspecific hyperintensities within the periventricular and deep white matter on T2/FLAIR images.
- A pannus posterior to C2 causing moderate canal stenosis on sagittal T2 images.
- Diffuse thickening of the retina bilaterally and enophthalmos on axial T2 images.
- Left temporomandibular joint (TMJ) degeneration on sagittal T2 images, with similar findings on the right side.
- Slightly prominent CSF spaces within the middle cranial fossa bilaterally on axial T2 images.
- Hyperostosis of the frontal bones along the metopic suture and absence of right frontal sinus pneumatization on axial T2 images.
- Increased spacing between the left maxillary molars on sagittal T2 images, with similar findings on the right side.

Given these findings, the initial differential diagnoses could include:

1. Multiple sclerosis or other demyelinating disease
2. Rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory arthropathy
3. Sarcoidosis
4. Fibrous dysplasia
5. Lymphoproliferative disorder

Confidence Level: 60%

After reviewing the detailed imaging findings provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08022018/tab-legends, the differential diagnoses can be revised to consider conditions that could explain the constellation of findings, including the pannus formation, TMJ degeneration, retinal thickening, and cranial hyperostosis:

1. Psoriatic arthritis
2. Ankylosing spondylitis
3. Spondyloarthropathies
4. Osteopetrosis
5. Gorlin syndrome (nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome)

These revised differential diagnoses take into account the combination of musculoskeletal, ocular, and cranial abnormalities seen in the imaging. The presence of a pannus and TMJ degeneration suggests an inflammatory arthropathy, while the cranial and dental findings may point towards a genetic or systemic condition.

Confidence Level: 75%

The confidence levels reflect the complexity of correlating a broad range of imaging findings with potential clinical syndromes. The actual diagnosis would require a thorough clinical evaluation, including a detailed patient history, physical examination, and possibly genetic testing or further imaging studies.",75,Insufficient
2018,Irreversible Cortical Blindness in Nonketotic Hyperglycemia,"Based on the content from the first link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03292018, a 65-year-old woman with poorly controlled diabetes presented with transient flashes of different colors lasting for a few seconds several times a day, followed by bilateral, symmetric, severe, irreversible cortical visual loss.

5. Migraine with aura

Confidence Level: 65%

After reviewing the detailed imaging findings provided in the content from the second link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03292018/tab-legends, which describes bilateral occipital subcortical and central pontine hypointensity on T2 MRI, mildly high signal in the pons and bilateral occipital subcortical white matter on DWI with corresponding low values on the ADC map, bilateral occipital gyral enhancement on T1 postcontrast, and patent proximal intracranial arteries on MRA, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)
2. Central pontine myelinolysis
3. Bilateral occipital lobe stroke
4. Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS)
5. Hypertensive encephalopathy

The imaging findings suggest an acute process affecting the white matter in the occipital lobes and pons, which could be consistent with a demyelinating process, ischemic event, or metabolic disturbance. The presence of gyral enhancement and diffusion restriction indicates an active process, possibly inflammatory or ischemic in nature.

Confidence Level: 80%

The confidence levels are based on the integration of clinical presentation and imaging findings. The actual diagnosis would require further clinical correlation, laboratory tests, and possibly additional imaging to confirm the underlying etiology. The revised differential diagnosis takes into account the bilateral and symmetric nature of the imaging findings, which is less typical for common ischemic strokes and suggests a more diffuse process.",80,Insufficient
2018,Langerhans cell histiocytosis (Eosinophilic granuloma),"Based on the summary of the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09202018, a 16-year-old girl presents with progressive headache, cutaneous reddening, and itching in the left cranial vault, and blood exams show increased inflammatory markers.

After reviewing the detailed imaging findings provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09202018/tab-legends, which describes a well-defined lytic lesion with beveled edges in the left frontal bone involving both the inner and outer table, peripheral enhancement with irregular central non-enhancement which may represent necrosis, and a lesion with a soft tissue subgaleal component and intracranial component that abuts the dura with increased enhancement, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Eosinophilic granuloma (Langerhans cell histiocytosis)
2. Osteomyelitis with associated abscess
3. Primary bone tumor (e.g., osteosarcoma, although rare in the skull)
4. Metastatic lesion (considering the age, possibly from a primary known to metastasize to bone in pediatric populations)
5. Sarcoidosis (less likely given the presentation but can cause lytic skull lesions)

The imaging findings suggest an aggressive process with both bone destruction and soft tissue involvement. The presence of a lytic lesion with beveled edges and the pattern of enhancement are more suggestive of a neoplastic process, either primary or secondary, or a granulomatous disease.

Confidence Level: 80%

The confidence levels are based on the integration of clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and detailed imaging characteristics. The actual diagnosis would require further clinical correlation, including a thorough history, physical examination, and possibly biopsy or additional imaging studies.

After reviewing the detailed imaging findings provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09132018/tab-legends, which describes diffuse thickening (maximum of 13 millimeters) of the subcutaneous tissue of the scalp without focal lesions, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Scalp edema due to local inflammation or infection
2. Morphea (localized scleroderma)
3. Lymphedema
4. Pachydermoperiostosis
5. Cutaneous angiosarcoma

The imaging findings suggest a diffuse process affecting the subcutaneous tissue without the presence of a discrete mass or focal lesion, which may be more indicative of an inflammatory or infiltrative process rather than a neoplastic one.

Confidence Level: 75%

The confidence levels reflect the integration of the clinical presentation and the imaging findings.

Without specific imaging findings, we can consider a range of differential diagnoses that could potentially explain these symptoms:

1. Herniated thoracic intervertebral disc
2. Thoracic spinal stenosis
3. Vertebral compression fracture
4. Primary or metastatic spinal tumor
5. Inflammatory or infectious spinal pathology (e.g., spondylodiscitis, epidural abscess)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02082018/tab-legends), which describes a rounded, well-defined posterior mediastinal mass on lateral chest x-ray, a large, heterogeneous, partially necrotic enhancing mass of the left posterior mediastinal region on sagittal and coronal CECT MPR images, vertebral body and posterior rib focal cortical bone erosions on axial CECT in bone window, and left foraminal enlargement and spinal canal involvement with cord compression on axial T1 and CE T1 MR images, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that can present with these specific imaging findings:

1. Neurogenic tumor (e.g., schwannoma, neurofibroma) - These can present as posterior mediastinal masses with bone erosion and spinal involvement.
2. Metastatic disease - Considering the presence of bone erosions and a large necrotic mass.
3. Primary bone tumor (e.g., chordoma, osteosarcoma) - These could explain the bone destruction and mass effect.
4. Lymphoma - Can present as a mediastinal mass with bone involvement, although it typically has a different imaging appearance.
5. Infectious processes (e.g., tuberculosis, fungal infection) - These can cause bone destruction and soft tissue masses, but would usually have additional systemic signs.

Confidence Level: 85%

The confidence levels reflect the increased specificity of the diagnoses after reviewing the imaging findings. The presence of a posterior mediastinal mass with bone erosion and spinal involvement is suggestive of a neurogenic tumor, such as a schwannoma or neurofibroma, which are common in this location and can cause the described imaging features. However, the differential also includes other neoplastic and infectious conditions that could present similarly.

5. Canavan disease - Another leukodystrophy, though it typically presents with more diffuse involvement.

Confidence Level: 85%

The confidence levels reflect the increased specificity of the diagnoses after reviewing the imaging findings. The presence of a tigroid pattern is particularly suggestive of a leukodystrophy, which narrows down the differential significantly. However, further clinical correlation, laboratory tests, and possibly genetic testing are required to reach a definitive diagnosis.",85,Excellent
2018,Midline Spinal Cord Hamartoma,"Based on the initial content provided from the link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07052018), a 79-year-old woman presents with left-sided hemiparesis, paresthesias, and numbness. Without specific imaging findings, we can consider a range of differential diagnoses that could potentially explain these symptoms:

1. Ischemic stroke
2. Hemorrhagic stroke
3. Brain tumor with mass effect or invasion of motor pathways
4. Multiple sclerosis or other demyelinating disease
5. Spinal cord lesion (e.g., compressive myelopathy)

Confidence Level: 65%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07052018/tab-legends), which describes an isointense exophytic lesion arising from the posterior aspect of the cervical cord at the C4 level with no evidence of enhancement on postcontrast images, and the presence of a skin dimple, indentation of the supraspinous ligament, and a presumed sinus tract, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that can present with these specific findings:

1. Meningioma - These are often isointense and can arise from the meninges, but typically enhance after contrast administration.
2. Neurofibroma/schwannoma - These can present as exophytic lesions and may not enhance if they are small or have a cystic component.
3. Ependymoma - These can arise from the central canal and present as exophytic lesions, but they often enhance with contrast.
4. Dermoid cyst - These can present as non-enhancing exophytic lesions and may be associated with skin abnormalities.
5. Spinal cord lipoma - These are typically associated with spinal dysraphism and may present with skin stigmata, but they have characteristic fat signal on MRI.

Confidence Level: 80%

The confidence levels reflect the increased specificity of the diagnoses after reviewing the imaging findings. The presence of a skin dimple and presumed sinus tract suggests a congenital etiology, such as a spinal dysraphism, which narrows down the differential significantly. However, further clinical correlation and possibly additional diagnostic tests such as a biopsy would be required to reach a definitive diagnosis.",80,Insufficient
2018,Miliary Brain Tuberculosis,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06212018), a 30-year-old patient presents with a history of progressive headache and unsteady gait for 6 months. Without specific imaging findings, we can consider a range of differential diagnoses that could potentially explain these symptoms:

1. Multiple sclerosis (MS) - Given the age and symptoms, MS could be a consideration.
2. Metastatic disease - Depending on the patient's history, multiple lesions could suggest metastases.
3. Infectious or inflammatory processes - Such as neurocysticercosis or other parasitic infections, or conditions like sarcoidosis or vasculitis.
4. Primary brain tumors - Such as gliomatosis cerebri or multiple low-grade gliomas.
5. Vascular malformations - Such as cavernous malformations, which may present with headaches and neurological symptoms.

Confidence Level: 60%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06212018/tab-legends), which describes multiple subcentimetric supra- and infratentorial nodular lesions with iso-to-low signal intensity on T1-weighted images, high signal intensity on FLAIR and T2-weighted images, pronounced perilesional edema, and both solid and peripheral ring enhancement patterns on contrast-enhanced images, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that can present with these specific MRI findings:

1. Metastatic disease - The presence of multiple lesions with ring enhancement is suggestive of metastases.
2. Neurosarcoidosis - Can present with multiple enhancing lesions and perilesional edema.
3. Primary CNS lymphoma - Can present with multiple lesions, though typically would have more homogeneous enhancement.
4. Infectious processes - Such as cerebral abscesses or neurocysticercosis, which can show ring-enhancing lesions.
5. Demyelinating disease - Such as tumefactive MS, which can present with ring-enhancing lesions and edema.

Confidence Level: 80%

The confidence levels reflect the increased specificity of the diagnoses after reviewing the imaging findings. The presence of multiple nodular lesions with both solid and ring enhancement patterns and significant perilesional edema is more suggestive of neoplastic or infectious processes. However, further clinical correlation, laboratory tests, and possibly biopsy would be required to reach a definitive diagnosis.",80,Insufficient
2018,Multinodular and Vacuolating Neuronal Tumor of the Cerebrum (MVNT),"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01252018), a 10-year-old with a history of infantile febrile seizures and Lyme disease presents for evaluation. Without specific imaging findings, we can consider a range of differential diagnoses that could potentially explain a neurological presentation in this context:

1. Post-infectious or autoimmune encephalitis
2. Residual effects of Lyme disease (neuroborreliosis)
3. Epilepsy-related changes or sequelae of febrile seizures
4. Focal cortical dysplasia or other congenital brain malformations
5. Low-grade glioma or other brain neoplasm

Confidence Level: 60%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01252018/tab-legends), which describes curvilinearly oriented cortical and juxtacortical nodular foci of T2 prolongation in the medial aspect of the right parietal lobe with no enhancement on postcontrast T1 images and no change observed when compared with a prior exam approximately 5 years earlier, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that can present with these specific MRI findings:

1. Focal cortical dysplasia - A congenital abnormality that can present with epilepsy and may show non-enhancing T2 prolongation.
2. Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET) - A benign brain tumor often associated with seizures, typically non-enhancing.
3. Low-grade glioma - Although these may show some enhancement, they can be stable over time.
4. Ulegyria related to past ischemic injury - This can cause cortical scarring that appears stable over time.
5. Cortical-based encephalomalacia secondary to previous trauma or infection - This would be stable and non-enhancing.

Confidence Level: 85%

The confidence levels reflect the increased specificity of the diagnoses after reviewing the imaging findings. The lack of enhancement and stability over a five-year period suggest a non-aggressive, likely congenital or long-standing lesion. The history of infantile febrile seizures and the imaging characteristics are particularly suggestive of a focal cortical dysplasia or a low-grade tumor like DNET. However, further clinical correlation and possibly additional diagnostic tests such as a functional MRI or electroencephalogram (EEG) would be required to reach a definitive diagnosis.",85,Good
2018,Neuroacanthocytosis,"Based on the content from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04052018), a 32-year-old man presents with seizures and orofacial dystonic movements for 2 years, and a peripheral blood smear showed acanthocytes. The presence of acanthocytes in the blood smear is a significant clue and can be associated with a group of diseases known as neuroacanthocytosis syndromes. Considering this information, the differential diagnoses could include:

1. Chorea-acanthocytosis (ChAc)
2. McLeod syndrome
3. Huntington's disease-like 2 (HDL2)
4. Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN)
5. Wilson's disease

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04052018/tab-legends), which describes symmetric hyperintensity in the bilateral putamen and the heads of the caudate nuclei on T2-weighted and FLAIR MRI, with no signal changes in the globus pallidus and no evidence of signal intensity alteration on T1-weighted MRI, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that can present with these specific MRI findings:

1. Chorea-acanthocytosis (ChAc) - The MRI findings and presence of acanthocytes are characteristic of this condition.
2. McLeod syndrome - Similar to ChAc, it is associated with neuroacanthocytosis and can show similar imaging findings.
3. Huntington's disease - Can cause caudate atrophy and hyperintensity in the putamen, but the presence of acanthocytes is not typical.
4. Wilson's disease - Can cause similar MRI findings, but typically also involves the liver and other systems.
5. Carbon monoxide poisoning or hypoxic-ischemic injury - These can cause bilateral symmetric lesions in the basal ganglia, but the clinical history would be different.

Confidence Level: 90%

The confidence levels reflect the increased specificity of the diagnoses after reviewing the imaging findings and considering the presence of acanthocytes. Chorea-acanthocytosis and McLeod syndrome are the most likely diagnoses given the combination of clinical, hematological, and radiological findings. However, further clinical correlation, laboratory tests, and genetic testing would be required to reach a definitive diagnosis.",90,Excellent
2018,Neurosarcoidosis,"Based on the initial content provided from the link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04122018), a 50-year-old woman presents with a 9-month history of gait disturbance. Without specific imaging findings, we can consider a range of differential diagnoses that could potentially explain these symptoms:

1. Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH)
2. Multiple sclerosis (MS)
3. Cerebral small vessel disease
4. Parkinson's disease or parkinsonism
5. Spinal cord compression or myelopathy

Confidence Level: 60%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04122018/tab-legends), which describes enlarged ventricles with periventricular T2 hyperintensity as a sign of transependymal CSF migration, severe focal narrowing of the distal aqueduct, a small enhancing nodule on sagittal postcontrast T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), nodular enhancing lesion with thickening of the pituitary stalk, and hypermetabolic mediastinal and hilar adenopathies on FDG PET-CT, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that can present with these specific MRI and PET-CT findings:

1. Central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma - Can present with enhancing lesions in the brain and pituitary stalk, and may be associated with systemic lymphadenopathy.
2. Germinoma or other germ cell tumors - Typically present with lesions in the pineal or suprasellar region and can cause aqueductal stenosis.
3. Sarcoidosis - Can cause pituitary stalk thickening, intracranial lesions, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
4. Metastatic disease - Can present with multiple enhancing lesions and lymphadenopathy, though less commonly involves the pituitary stalk.
5. Tuberculosis (TB) or other infectious granulomatous diseases - Can cause intracranial lesions, pituitary stalk thickening, and lymphadenopathy.

Confidence Level: 85%

The confidence levels reflect the increased specificity of the diagnoses after reviewing the imaging findings. The combination of central nervous system findings and systemic lymphadenopathy is suggestive of a systemic process with CNS involvement, such as lymphoma or sarcoidosis. However, definitive diagnosis would likely require further investigation, including biopsy of the CNS lesions or lymph nodes, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and possibly additional imaging studies.",85,Excellent
2018,Nonketotic Hyperglycinemia (NKH),"Based on the initial content provided from the link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01182018), a term neonate born to consanguineous parents becomes progressively lethargic, hypotonic, and apneic 2 hours after birth, requiring mechanical ventilation. Considering these clinical features, the differential diagnoses could include:

1. Neonatal encephalopathy due to hypoxic-ischemic injury
2. Inborn errors of metabolism
3. Neonatal sepsis or meningitis
4. Congenital brain malformations
5. Intracranial hemorrhage

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01182018/tab-legends), which describes abnormal increased signal in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, in the dorsal pons and along the medial longitudinal fasciculi on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion restriction on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map, and an abnormal peak at 3.5 ppm corresponding to glycine on multivoxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that can present with these specific MRI findings:

1. Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH) - The presence of an abnormal glycine peak on MRS is characteristic of this metabolic disorder.
2. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) - Can show diffusion restriction but typically does not have the abnormal glycine peak.
3. Brainstem injury or malformation - Could explain the signal abnormalities in the dorsal pons but would not account for the abnormal glycine peak.
4. Leukodystrophy - Some forms may present early with diffusion restriction, but the MRS findings of glycine are not typical.
5. Mitochondrial disorders - Can present with a variety of CNS findings, but the specific MRS peak for glycine is not characteristic.

Confidence Level: 95%

The confidence levels reflect the increased specificity of the diagnoses after reviewing the imaging findings. The abnormal peak at 3.5 ppm corresponding to glycine on MRS is a strong indicator of Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH), a condition that can present with severe neurological symptoms in neonates and is consistent with the clinical history of consanguinity and early-onset neurological symptoms. The imaging findings support this diagnosis, making it highly likely. However, confirmation would typically require biochemical testing to measure glycine levels in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).",95,Excellent
2018,Oculo-Auriculo-Vertebral Spectrum/Goldenhar Syndrome,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02012018), an 8-year-old boy presents with right hemifacial and mandibular hypoplasia, right-sided microtia, and associated systemic malformations including esophageal atresia, ventricular septal defect, urogenital malformations, and thoracic asymmetry with fusion of D7 and D8 vertebrae. The differential diagnoses for these clinical features could include:

1. Goldenhar syndrome (oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum)
2. Hemifacial microsomia
3. Treacher Collins syndrome
4. CHARGE syndrome
5. Craniofacial microsomia

Confidence Level: 80%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02012018/tab-legends), which describes maxillofacial CT findings of facial asymmetry with right mandibular hypoplasia/dysmorphism, absence of the right zygomatic arch, atrophy of right temporal, masseter, and lateral pterygoid muscles, absence of the right foramen ovale and hypoplasia of the right pterygoid canal, and absence of the right external auditory canal, tympanic cavity, and ossicular chain, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that can present with these specific imaging findings:

1. Goldenhar syndrome (oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum) - The findings are highly suggestive of this syndrome, which includes facial asymmetry, ear anomalies, and vertebral defects.
2. Hemifacial microsomia - Similar to Goldenhar syndrome but typically without the vertebral anomalies.
3. Treacher Collins syndrome - Characterized by craniofacial anomalies, but typically includes bilateral involvement and presents with different ear anomalies.
4. CHARGE syndrome - Includes a broader spectrum of anomalies, some of which are not described in this case.
5. Pierre Robin sequence - Involves mandibular hypoplasia but does not typically include the range of anomalies seen in this case.

Confidence Level: 95%

The confidence levels reflect the increased specificity of the diagnoses after reviewing the imaging findings. The constellation of clinical and imaging findings, including facial asymmetry, ear anomalies, and vertebral defects, is most consistent with Goldenhar syndrome. The presence of systemic malformations such as esophageal atresia and ventricular septal defect further supports this diagnosis. However, a definitive diagnosis would likely require genetic testing and a thorough clinical evaluation to assess for other features of the syndrome and to rule out similar conditions.",95,Excellent
2018,Opercular Syndrome due to Bilateral Perisylvian Polymicrogyria,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05312018), a 5-year-old boy presents with developmental delay, drooling of saliva, an inability to protrude the tongue, slurred speech, and multiple episodes of seizures since early childhood, with a history of perinatal asphyxia. The differential diagnoses for these clinical features could include:

1. Cerebral palsy due to perinatal asphyxia
2. Focal cortical dysplasia
3. Pediatric stroke with resultant epilepsy
4. Genetic or metabolic disorder affecting the brain
5. Structural brain anomaly such as lissencephaly

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05312018/tab-legends), which describes bilaterally symmetric polymicrogyria in perisylvian regions, a wide sylvian fissure, and dysplastic and incomplete opercula, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that can present with these specific MRI findings:

1. Bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria (BPP) - The imaging findings are characteristic of this condition.
2. Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection - Can cause polymicrogyria and other brain malformations.
3. Zellweger spectrum disorder - A peroxisomal disorder that can present with polymicrogyria.
4. Schizencephaly - Open-lipped schizencephaly can present with a wide sylvian fissure and may be associated with polymicrogyria.
5. Genetic syndromes associated with polymicrogyria - There are several genetic syndromes that can present with polymicrogyria as a feature.

Confidence Level: 90%

The confidence levels reflect the increased specificity of the diagnoses after reviewing the imaging findings. The presence of bilaterally symmetric polymicrogyria in perisylvian regions is highly suggestive of Bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria (BPP), which is a well-recognized malformation of cortical development associated with the clinical symptoms described. However, further clinical correlation, genetic testing, and possibly metabolic studies would be required to reach a definitive diagnosis and to rule out other causes of polymicrogyria.",90,Excellent
2018,Osteosarcoma of the Maxillary Sinus,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03012018), a 68-year-old woman presents with a palpable mass in the left maxillary region and no relevant medical history. The differential diagnoses for a palpable mass in the maxillary region could include:

1. Maxillary sinusitis with or without abscess formation
2. Benign neoplasms such as odontogenic tumors or fibro-osseous lesions
3. Malignant neoplasms such as squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the maxillary sinus
4. Sarcomas, including osteosarcoma or chondrosarcoma
5. Metastatic disease to the maxillary region

Confidence Level: 65%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03012018/tab-legends), which describes an expansive mass in the left maxillary sinus with an osteoid-like matrix and peripheral spiculae that erode the sinus walls and invade the premaxillary and masticator space soft tissue and the nasal fossa, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that can present with these specific imaging findings:

1. Osteosarcoma - The presence of an osteoid-like matrix and aggressive features such as erosion and invasion are suggestive of this malignant bone tumor.
2. Chondrosarcoma - Can present with an osteoid matrix but typically has a different pattern of calcification.
3. Fibro-osseous lesion - Such as fibrous dysplasia or ossifying fibroma, although these are typically less aggressive.
4. Odontogenic carcinoma - A possibility given the location, but would usually present differently on imaging.
5. Metastatic disease - Rare in the maxillary sinus but could present with aggressive features.

Confidence Level: 85%

The confidence levels reflect the increased specificity of the diagnoses after reviewing the imaging findings. The aggressive nature of the lesion, with an osteoid-like matrix and peripheral spiculae, is highly suggestive of a primary bone malignancy such as osteosarcoma, especially given the erosion of the sinus walls and invasion into adjacent structures. However, a definitive diagnosis would require histopathological examination following a biopsy or surgical resection of the lesion.",85,Excellent
2018,Paradoxical Cerebral Herniation,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11152018), a 48-year-old patient underwent a bilateral, frontal decompressive craniectomy after a postoperative hematoma following an olfactory meningioma resection and then experienced a sudden neurological deterioration one week later. The differential diagnoses for sudden neurological deterioration after craniectomy could include:

1. Postoperative infection, such as meningitis or abscess
2. Recurrent or residual hematoma
3. Cerebral edema or herniation
4. Seizure activity post-surgery
5. Ischemic stroke due to vascular injury or compression

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11152018/tab-legends), which describes unenhanced brain CT findings of a bifrontal craniectomy with a postoperative, left frontal hemorrhage within the surgical bed, and one week follow-up showing bilateral, frontal parenchyma herniation in the opposite direction to the craniectomy causing effacement of the supratentorial and infratentorial subarachnoid cisterns and compression of the midbrain, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that can present with these specific imaging findings:

1. Syndrome of the trephined (sinking skin flap syndrome) - The imaging findings of herniation in the opposite direction to the craniectomy and normalization after supine positioning are characteristic of this condition.
2. Postoperative cerebral edema - Can cause mass effect and midbrain compression but would not typically resolve with supine positioning.
3. Hydrocephalus - Can cause effacement of subarachnoid cisterns but would not typically cause bilateral frontal parenchyma herniation.
4. Pneumocephalus - Can occur postoperatively and may cause neurological deterioration, but the imaging findings would be different.
5. Delayed postoperative ischemia - Could cause neurological deterioration but would not explain the imaging findings of herniation and normalization with positioning.

Confidence Level: 95%

The confidence levels reflect the increased specificity of the diagnoses after reviewing the imaging findings. The description of bilateral, frontal parenchyma herniation in the opposite direction to the craniectomy, with normalization upon supine positioning, is highly suggestive of the Syndrome of the trephined. This condition occurs when a large craniectomy defect allows atmospheric pressure to displace brain tissue, which can be reversed by changing the patient's position. The imaging findings and the clinical course are consistent with this diagnosis, making it the most likely cause of the patient's sudden neurological deterioration.",95,Excellent
2018,Parsonage-Turner Syndrome,"Based on the content provided from the link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05242018), a 44-year-old woman presents with acute left upper extremity paralysis and pain following three days of flu-like symptoms. The differential diagnoses for acute upper extremity paralysis and pain with a recent history of flu-like symptoms could include:

1. Brachial plexitis or neuralgic amyotrophy (Parsonage-Turner syndrome)
2. Cervical radiculopathy
3. Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (Guillain-Barr_ syndrome)
4. Transverse myelitis
5. Cervical spinal cord compression or lesion

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05242018/tab-legends), which describes moderate edema involving the left scalene and subcutaneous fat surrounding the brachial plexus, thickening and increased signal of the left brachial plexus with ""undulations"" of the upper cervical nerve roots, and a ""bullseye"" sign of the C5 nerve root, as well as moderate edema in the left supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and trapezius muscles, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that can present with these specific MRI findings:

1. Brachial plexitis or neuralgic amyotrophy (Parsonage-Turner syndrome) - The MRI findings of brachial plexus edema and the ""bullseye"" sign are characteristic of this condition.
2. Cervical radiculopathy - Could cause nerve root edema but usually does not involve the brachial plexus to this extent.
3. Herpes zoster (shingles) - Can cause severe pain and nerve root involvement, but the distribution would typically follow a dermatomal pattern.
4. Lyme disease - Can cause peripheral neuropathy and radiculopathy, but would typically have other systemic manifestations.
5. Autoimmune or inflammatory conditions - Such as sarcoidosis or rheumatoid arthritis, which can affect the brachial plexus but would likely have additional systemic features.

Confidence Level: 90%

The confidence levels reflect the increased specificity of the diagnoses after reviewing the imaging findings. The acute onset of symptoms, the presence of flu-like symptoms prior to the onset, and the MRI findings of brachial plexus edema with nerve root ""undulations"" and the ""bullseye"" sign are highly suggestive of brachial plexitis, also known as Parsonage-Turner syndrome. This condition is often idiopathic or post-infectious and can present with sudden, severe pain followed by muscle weakness or paralysis. The diagnosis is primarily clinical and radiological, and the imaging findings are consistent with this syndrome.",90,Excellent
2018,Perineural cysts associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD),"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12272018), a 59-year-old woman with a history of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and cerebral aneurysm presents with concern for a paraspinal neural tumor per chest CT. The differential diagnoses for a paraspinal mass in the context of ADPKD could include:

1. Extrarenal or perirenal cysts associated with ADPKD
2. Paraspinal neoplasm, such as schwannoma or neurofibroma
3. Metastatic disease, considering the history of cerebral aneurysm if it was previously treated with interventions that could predispose to cancer
4. Abscess or infectious process, particularly if there is a history of immunosuppression or invasive procedures
5. Arachnoid cyst, which can sometimes present adjacent to the spine

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12272018/tab-legends), which describes non-contrast axial abdominal CT findings of numerous rounded hypodense structures associated with the exiting nerve roots of the thoracic spine, extensive cysts of the kidneys and liver, and MRI confirming numerous rounded T2 hyperintense structures associated with the exiting nerve roots consistent with perineural cysts, as well as a vertebral artery arteriogram showing a small, focal dilatation consistent with a dissecting aneurysm, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that can present with these specific imaging findings:

1. Perineural (Tarlov) cysts - The imaging findings of rounded structures associated with the nerve roots are characteristic of this condition.
2. Arachnoid cysts - Can also present as T2 hyperintense structures but are typically located within the dural sac.
3. Neurenteric cysts - Rare congenital cysts that can be associated with spinal anomalies.
4. Meningeal cysts - Such as meningoceles, which can present with similar imaging findings but would typically be midline.
5. Schwannoma or neurofibroma - These nerve sheath tumors can be associated with nerve roots but would usually enhance and have a different appearance on imaging.

Confidence Level: 95%

The confidence levels reflect the increased specificity of the diagnoses after reviewing the imaging findings. The presence of numerous rounded hypodense structures associated with the exiting nerve roots of the thoracic spine, along with the extensive cysts of the kidneys and liver, is highly suggestive of perineural cysts, which are often associated with ADPKD. The additional finding of a dissecting aneurysm of the vertebral artery is consistent with the known history of cerebral aneurysm in the context of ADPKD. The imaging findings are consistent with these diagnoses, making them the most likely causes of the patient's presentation.",95,Excellent
2018,Perisylvian lipoma associated with a left lentiform nucleus infarct,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 14-month-old boy with right-sided facial asymmetry, reduced ability to walk, and not using the right arm or leg, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08232018), here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Cerebral palsy
2. Pediatric stroke
3. Brain tumor
4. Infection (e.g., encephalitis or abscess)
5. Congenital brain malformation

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional information provided in the diagram description from the American Journal of Neuroradiology (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08232018/tab-legends), which includes non-enhanced head CT showing low attenuation extra-axial lesion in the left perisylvian location and parenchymal low attenuation in the left lentiform nucleus with mild surrounding mass effect, as well as MRI findings of high signal intensity in the left perisylvian subarachnoid lesion and restricted diffusion in the left lenticulostriate infarct, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Arachnoid cyst with associated infarct
2. Low-grade glioma with secondary stroke
3. Encephalomalacia secondary to previous insult (e.g., trauma, infection)
4. Congenital malformation with associated ischemic changes
5. Focal cortical dysplasia with associated stroke

Confidence Level: 85%

The presence of restricted diffusion on the ADC and DWI images confirming a left lenticulostriate infarct, along with the high signal intensity lesion similar to subcutaneous fat, suggests a vascular event with possible associated anomalies or lesions. It is important to consider the age of the patient and the typical etiologies of such findings in this age group. Further clinical correlation and potentially additional imaging or laboratory studies would be necessary to refine the diagnosis.",85,Insufficient
2018,Pleomorphic Xanthoastrocytoma (PXA),"Based on the summary of the case presented on the American Journal of Neuroradiology website (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05032018), a 33-year-old woman with right partial motor seizures, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Glioma
2. Meningioma
3. Metastatic brain lesion
4. Demyelinating disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis)
5. Vascular malformation (e.g., arteriovenous malformation)

Confidence Level: 60%

After reviewing the additional information provided in the diagram description from the American Journal of Neuroradiology (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05032018/tab-legends), which includes imaging findings such as a T2 hyperintense left precentral nodular cortical lesion with homogeneous enhancement and leptomeningeal involvement, no restricted diffusion, increased rCBV ratio on perfusion imaging, and histopathology showing neoplastic proliferation with dense glial cellularity, moderate pleomorphism, and low mitotic index without necrosis or microvascular proliferation, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Low-grade glioma (e.g., astrocytoma)
2. Oligodendroglioma
3. Ganglioglioma
4. Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET)
5. Meningioma with cortical invasion

Confidence Level: 85%

The imaging and histopathological features suggest a neoplastic process with glial cellularity and leptomeningeal involvement, which is more consistent with a primary brain tumor. The absence of necrosis and microvascular proliferation, along with a low mitotic index, suggests a lower-grade neoplasm. The increased rCBV ratio could be indicative of a tumor with higher metabolic activity, although it is not necessarily specific for high-grade tumors. The final diagnosis would require integration of the imaging findings, histopathology, and possibly additional molecular testing.",85,Insufficient

After reviewing the additional information provided in the diagram description from the American Journal of Neuroradiology (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10182018/tab-legends), which includes imaging findings such as bilateral solid parotid masses with cystic areas on the right, significant restricted diffusion, and diffuse enhancement of the parotid masses, as well as bilateral cervical lymphadenopathies, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Lymphoma, particularly MALT lymphoma associated with Sj_gren's syndrome
2. Bilateral metastatic disease to the parotid glands and cervical lymph nodes
3. Infectious parotitis with abscess formation and reactive lymphadenopathy
4. Sarcoidosis with bilateral parotid gland and nodal involvement
5. Benign lymphoepithelial lesions associated with Sj_gren's syndrome

Confidence Level: 80%

The presence of bilateral parotid masses with cystic changes and restricted diffusion, along with the patient's history of Sj_gren's syndrome, increases the suspicion for lymphoma, particularly MALT lymphoma, which is known to be associated with this autoimmune condition. The imaging findings also raise the possibility of metastatic disease, although this is less common in the parotid glands. Infectious causes and benign lymphoepithelial lesions are also considered, given the patient's autoimmune background. Sarcoidosis is less likely but remains a differential diagnosis due to its potential to cause bilateral glandular and nodal involvement. Further diagnostic workup, including biopsy and possibly PET-CT, would be necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis.",80,Excellent
2018,Primary Leptomeningeal Lymphoma,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 6-year-old boy with insidious malaise, paraparesis, horizontal diplopia, and a left facial palsy, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10042018), here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Guillain-Barr_ syndrome
2. Brainstem glioma
3. Multiple sclerosis or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)
4. Infectious or inflammatory meningitis (e.g., bacterial, viral, or tuberculous)
5. Neurosarcoidosis

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional information provided in the diagram description from the American Journal of Neuroradiology (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10042018/tab-legends), which includes imaging findings such as diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement in the cerebellar folia, brainstem, and cervical spinal cord, as well as nodular, thick enhancement in the ventral surface of the conus medullaris, roots of the cauda equina, and cervical nerve roots, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis
2. Infectious meningitis with associated radiculitis (e.g., Lyme disease, tuberculosis)
3. Inflammatory conditions such as neurosarcoidosis or chronic meningitis
4. Guillain-Barr_ syndrome with central nervous system involvement
5. Hematologic malignancy with CNS involvement (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma)

Confidence Level: 85%

The presence of diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement and nodular thickening along the conus medullaris and nerve roots suggests a process involving both the meninges and nerve roots, which could be infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic. The clinical history and imaging findings would prompt further investigation, including cerebrospinal fluid analysis and possibly biopsy, to differentiate between these conditions and arrive at a definitive diagnosis.",85,Good
2018,Rabies Encephalomyelitis,"Based on the clinical history of a 19-year-old man with altered sensorium for the last 10 days, a history of a dog bite 40 days prior, and the death of the dog 2 days after the incident, without receiving post-exposure prophylaxis, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01112018), here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Rabies encephalitis
2. Viral encephalitis (e.g., herpes simplex virus)
3. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)
4. Bacterial meningitis with secondary encephalitis
5. Autoimmune encephalitis

Confidence Level: 80%

After reviewing the additional information provided in the diagram description from the American Journal of Neuroradiology (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01112018/tab-legends), which includes imaging findings such as bilateral symmetric swelling and hyperintensity in the basal ganglia and insular cortex, with hemorrhagic foci on T1-weighted images and restricted diffusion on DWI of the insular cortex and external capsules, as well as hyperintensity in the hippocampi, amygdala, temporal lobes, and midbrain, and in the brainstem and upper cervical region, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Rabies encephalitis
2. Viral encephalitis with hemorrhagic complications (e.g., herpes simplex virus, Japanese encephalitis)
3. Acute necrotizing encephalopathy
4. Toxic encephalopathy (e.g., carbon monoxide poisoning, drug overdose)
5. Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis

Confidence Level: 90%

The imaging findings of bilateral symmetric lesions with hemorrhagic foci and the clinical history of a dog bite without post-exposure prophylaxis strongly suggest rabies encephalitis. This is further supported by the rapid progression of symptoms and the involvement of specific brain regions such as the basal ganglia, insular cortex, and brainstem, which are typical of rabies. Other viral encephalitides and acute necrotizing encephalopathy are also considered due to the imaging pattern, but the history of a dog bite is a critical clue. Toxic and paraneoplastic causes are less likely but included for completeness. The definitive diagnosis would likely be confirmed through additional laboratory testing, including rabies virus detection in saliva, serum, cerebrospinal fluid, or brain biopsy.",90,Excellent
2018,Radiation necrosis mimicking tumor progression,"Based on the initial content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11082018), a 29-year-old man with an anaplastic astrocytoma in the left temporal lobe, treated with partial tumor resection and radiotherapy, and a new area of contrast enhancement in the tumor on MRI 4 months after radiotherapy, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Tumor recurrence
2. Radiation necrosis
3. Pseudoprogression
4. Post-surgical changes
5. Infectious process (e.g., abscess)

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the additional information provided in the diagram description from the American Journal of Neuroradiology (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11082018/tab-legends), which includes imaging findings such as a ring-like lesion within the partially resected tumor with a liquified internal area, low ADC values surrounding this area, peripheral enhancement, and low increase in rCBV values on perfusion imaging, with nearly complete resolution of contrast enhancement on follow-up MRI scans, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Pseudoprogression
2. Radiation necrosis
3. Tumor recurrence with central necrosis
4. Post-surgical changes with associated granulation tissue
5. Infectious process (e.g., abscess) with subsequent resolution

Confidence Level: 85%

The imaging findings of a ring-like lesion with low ADC values and peripheral enhancement, along with the clinical context of recent radiotherapy and the subsequent resolution on follow-up MRI, suggest pseudoprogression or radiation necrosis as more likely than tumor recurrence. Pseudoprogression is a treatment-related phenomenon that can mimic tumor progression on imaging but typically resolves without further intervention, which seems to be the case here given the resolution on follow-up scans. Radiation necrosis is also a possibility, but it usually does not resolve spontaneously and may require treatment. The other differentials are less likely given the resolution on follow-up and the patient's treatment history. Further clinical correlation and possibly advanced imaging or biopsy would be necessary to distinguish between these conditions definitively.",85,Excellent
2018,Rhinocerebral Mucormycosis with Perineural Spread Pattern,"Based on the clinical history of a 54-year-old diabetic woman with immunosuppressive therapy due to renal transplant, previous dental abscess treated with oral antibiotics, and progressive right-sided facial swelling and proptosis requiring surgical malar debridement with poor clinical response, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08162018), here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Osteomyelitis of the maxilla or mandible
2. Orbital cellulitis
3. Invasive fungal sinusitis
4. Malignancy (e.g., squamous cell carcinoma related to chronic infection)
5. Abscess formation secondary to dental infection

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the additional information provided in the diagram description from the American Journal of Neuroradiology (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08162018/tab-legends), which includes imaging findings such as a molar tooth extraction site, a fluid collection with gas bubbles in the right maxillary region and hard palate, soft tissue inflammatory changes, right exophthalmos, stranding of the intraconal fat, an extraconal collection, occupation of the right ethmoid cells and the sphenoid sinus, heterogeneous enhancement of the cavernous sinus, and extension along the cisternal segment of the trigeminal nerve into the pons with hypersignal, enhancement, and restricted diffusion in the medial temporal lobe and along the trigeminal nerve, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Invasive fungal sinusitis with intracranial extension
2. Orbital cellulitis with abscess formation and cavernous sinus thrombosis
3. Malignancy with perineural invasion
4. Osteomyelitis with contiguous spread to the orbit and intracranial structures
5. Necrotizing fasciitis with orbital and intracranial involvement

Confidence Level: 90%

The imaging findings of gas bubbles, fluid collection, and the extensive inflammatory changes involving the orbit, sinuses, and intracranial structures, particularly in an immunocompromised patient, strongly suggest an invasive infectious process. Invasive fungal sinusitis, especially mucormycosis in diabetic or immunocompromised patients, is a critical consideration due to its aggressive nature and propensity for rapid spread along vascular and neural planes. The presence of cavernous sinus involvement raises the concern for cavernous sinus thrombosis, which can complicate orbital cellulitis or invasive infections. Malignancy with perineural invasion is less likely given the acute presentation but remains a differential diagnosis due to the patient's immunocompromised status. Osteomyelitis and necrotizing fasciitis are also considered due to the potential for contiguous spread of infection from the oral cavity. Immediate clinical intervention, including further diagnostic workup and possibly surgical exploration, is crucial.",90,Excellent
2018,Schwannoma mimicking MPE,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 30-year-old woman with progressive, central lumbar back pain without radiculopathy or neurologic symptoms, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11012018), here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Lumbar disc herniation
2. Spinal ependymoma
3. Spinal meningioma
4. Schwannoma or neurofibroma
5. Hemangioblastoma

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional information provided in the diagram description from the American Journal of Neuroradiology (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11012018/tab-legends), which includes imaging findings such as an intradural T2 heterogeneously hyperintense mass with internal cystic change at the T12 vertebral level near the region of the conus medullaris, prominent lateral displacement of the spinal cord, and heterogeneous enhancement of the mass without invasion into adjacent structures or intraforaminal extension, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Spinal ependymoma
2. Myxopapillary ependymoma
3. Schwannoma
4. Paraganglioma
5. Spinal astrocytoma

Confidence Level: 85%

The imaging characteristics of the mass, including its location near the conus medullaris, the presence of cystic changes, and the lack of invasion into adjacent structures, are more suggestive of a primary spinal cord tumor. Ependymomas, particularly myxopapillary ependymomas, which are commonly found in the conus medullaris region, are a strong consideration. Schwannomas are also a possibility given the intradural extramedullary location of the mass. Paragangliomas and spinal astrocytomas are less common but should be included in the differential diagnosis due to their imaging appearance and potential location. Further evaluation, including a detailed neurological examination and possibly surgical intervention with histopathological analysis, would be necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis.",85,Excellent
2018,Spinal Arachnoid Cyst with Intramedullary Extension,"Based on the clinical history provided in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04262018), a 24-year-old woman with a history of progressive spastic paraparesis since age 7 and no history of bladder or bowel disturbances, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Hereditary spastic paraplegia
2. Spinal cord tumor (e.g., ependymoma)
3. Multiple sclerosis
4. Spinal arteriovenous malformation
5. Tethered cord syndrome

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional information provided in the diagram description from the American Journal of Neuroradiology (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04262018/tab-legends), which includes imaging findings such as a hyperintense intradural cystic lesion with a superior extramedullary component and an inferior intramedullary component consisting of multiple small cystic areas in the cord, no associated enhancement, anterior displacement of the spinal cord, and multiple small cystic areas within the intramedullary component, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Spinal arachnoid cyst with syringomyelia
2. Neurenteric cyst
3. Spinal cord tumor with cystic degeneration (e.g., ependymoma)
4. Spinal dermoid/epidermoid cyst
5. Diastematomyelia with associated cystic formation

Confidence Level: 85%

The imaging characteristics of the lesion, particularly the presence of a cystic lesion with both extramedullary and intramedullary components and the lack of enhancement, suggest a non-neoplastic cystic lesion such as an arachnoid cyst with associated syringomyelia. Neurenteric cysts are also a consideration due to their intradural location and cystic nature. Spinal cord tumors with cystic degeneration, such as ependymomas, are less likely given the lack of enhancement but cannot be completely ruled out. Spinal dermoid/epidermoid cysts and diastematomyelia with associated cystic formation are also included due to their potential to present with similar imaging findings. The definitive diagnosis would likely require surgical exploration and histopathological examination.",85,Excellent
2018,Spinal Hydatid Cyst,"Based on the clinical history of a 30-year-old man with a history of progressive low back pain radiating to the posterolateral aspect of his left leg for 5 months, as provided in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03222018), here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Lumbar disc herniation
2. Spinal extradural arachnoid cyst
3. Nerve sheath tumor (e.g., schwannoma, neurofibroma)
4. Spinal epidural abscess
5. Spinal extradural hematoma

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional information provided in the diagram description from the American Journal of Neuroradiology (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03222018/tab-legends), which includes imaging findings such as a posterior extradural septated cystic lesion of CSF signal intensity on T2WI and T1WI, extending from the T12 to L2 levels, with no or minimal enhancement of the lesion and anterolateral displacement of the cord, and CT axial bone window showing involvement of posterior elements on the left side, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Spinal extradural arachnoid cyst
2. Synovial cyst (e.g., facet joint cyst)
3. Tarlov cyst
4. Spinal meningeal cyst (e.g., meningocele)
5. Extradural cystic lesion secondary to degenerative spine disease

Confidence Level: 85%

The imaging characteristics of the lesion, including its cystic nature, CSF signal intensity, lack of significant enhancement, and the involvement of posterior elements, suggest a non-neoplastic extradural cystic lesion. A spinal extradural arachnoid cyst is a strong consideration given these findings. Synovial cysts, Tarlov cysts, and other spinal meningeal cysts are also included in the differential due to their potential to present with similar imaging features. Extradural cystic lesions secondary to degenerative spine disease are less likely but should be considered. Further evaluation, including clinical correlation and possibly surgical consultation, would be necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis.",85,Insufficient
2018,Subperiosteal Osteoid Osteoma,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 33-year-old man with back pain and the MRI findings from the American Journal of Neuroradiology (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06072018), which demonstrate a well-defined subcentimeter lesion involving the left superior articular facet of the left T11, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

2. Osteoblastoma
3. Chondroid lesion (e.g., enchondroma)
4. Bone metastasis
5. Intraosseous ganglion cyst

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the additional information provided in the diagram description from the American Journal of Neuroradiology (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06072018/tab-legends), which includes imaging findings such as the lesion being hypointense on T2-weighted images (T2WI) and mildly hyperintense on T1-weighted images (T1WI), associated marrow edema and enhancement in the left neural arch of the vertebral body, paravertebral soft-tissue edema, bone CT showing central punctate calcifications within the lytic lesion, and dynamic contrast evaluation with time intensity curves showing rapid early uptake of contrast on the arterial phase with a slow washout, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Osteoid osteoma
2. Osteoblastoma
3. Brodie's abscess (subacute osteomyelitis)
4. Chondroblastoma
5. Aneurysmal bone cyst (secondary changes)

Confidence Level: 90%

The imaging characteristics, particularly the size of the lesion, the pattern of contrast enhancement, and the presence of central calcifications, are highly suggestive of an osteoid osteoma. This benign bone tumor is known for its nocturnal pain that responds to NSAIDs and its characteristic radiologic appearance. Osteoblastoma is a larger lesion but can have similar imaging features and clinical presentation. Brodie's abscess is a form of subacute osteomyelitis that can present with similar imaging findings, including the edema and enhancement patterns. Chondroblastoma and aneurysmal bone cysts are less likely but included due to their potential to present with similar imaging features. Further evaluation, including clinical correlation and possibly biopsy, would be necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis.",90,Excellent

Without specific imaging findings, a broad range of differential diagnoses could be considered. Here are five potential differential diagnoses:

1. Cervical radiculopathy
2. Cervical disc herniation
3. Cervical spondylosis
4. Brachial plexus injury
5. Cervical spine tumor or metastasis

Confidence Level: 60%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided from the legends tab at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10112018/tab-legends, which describe plain films and bone CT showing widening of the right C2-C3 neural foramen with focal bone erosion, and MRI images demonstrating a dumbbell-shaped tumor at the right C2-C3 neural foramen with thecal sac compression and encasement of the right vertebral artery, the differential diagnoses can be revised to be more specific:

1. Nerve sheath tumor (e.g., schwannoma or neurofibroma)
2. Meningioma
3. Metastatic disease
4. Paraganglioma
5. Vertebral artery aneurysm

These revised differential diagnoses are based on the characteristic imaging findings of a dumbbell-shaped lesion with bone erosion and involvement of the neural foramen, which are suggestive of a tumor that may originate from or involve the nerve roots or sheaths.

2018,Traumatic Middle Meningeal Artery Pseudoaneurysm,"Based on the initial summary provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology case of the week, accessed via https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06282018, a 61-year-old woman has follow-up imaging 16 weeks after sustaining multiple right-sided frontal, parietal, and temporal bone fractures as well as bilateral subdural, subarachnoid, and intraparenchymal hemorrhages, including bilateral anterior temporal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhages. Here are five potential differential diagnoses:

1. Post-traumatic sequelae with chronic subdural hematoma
2. Post-traumatic encephalomalacia
3. Post-traumatic cerebral aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm
4. Post-traumatic infection or abscess
5. Delayed post-traumatic hemorrhage

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided from the legends tab at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06282018/tab-legends, which describe a well-circumscribed extra-axial hyperdense lesion within the right middle cranial fossa surrounded by encephalomalacia, and CTA images showing a saccular partially thrombosed aneurysm in contiguity with the right middle meningeal artery underlying a depressed right temporal bone fracture, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Middle meningeal artery pseudoaneurysm
2. Chronic subdural hematoma with calcification
3. Encephalomalacia secondary to trauma
4. Epidural hematoma
5. Intracranial neoplasm (less likely given the context of trauma)

The presence of a saccular partially thrombosed aneurysm in contiguity with the right middle meningeal artery and the history of trauma with a depressed skull fracture strongly suggest a pseudoaneurysm of the middle meningeal artery.

Confidence Level: 95%

The revised differential diagnosis is highly specific to the imaging findings and the clinical history of trauma, which makes the diagnosis of a middle meningeal artery pseudoaneurysm very likely. The confidence level reflects the increased specificity of the diagnosis after reviewing the detailed imaging description.",95,Excellent

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08302018/tab-legends, which describe axial and coronal T2 images showing replacement of the white matter by near-CSF intensity signal, preserved cortex and deep grey matter nuclei, severe callosal and cerebellar atrophy on sagittal T1, and white matter signal suppression on axial FLAIR imaging following CSF intensity, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Leukodystrophy (e.g., metachromatic leukodystrophy, Krabbe disease)
2. Mitochondrial disorders (e.g., Kearns-Sayre syndrome)
3. Infectious or post-infectious encephalitis leading to encephalomalacia
4. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy
5. Alexander disease

The imaging findings of severe white matter changes with preservation of the cortex and deep grey matter nuclei, along with callosal and cerebellar atrophy, are more suggestive of a leukodystrophy or a mitochondrial disorder. These conditions often present with progressive neurological symptoms, including ataxia and spasticity.

Confidence Level: 85%

The revised differential diagnosis takes into account the specific imaging findings and the clinical presentation of progressive neurological decline. The confidence level reflects the increased specificity of the diagnosis after reviewing the detailed imaging description.",85,Good

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11292018/tab-legends, which describe hyperintense lesions in the territory of the left anterior choroidal artery on axial DWI images with corresponding low ADC values, focal stenosis of the proximal A1 segment of the left anterior cerebral artery, luminal irregularities of the terminal segment of the left internal carotid artery (ICA), and concentric and homogeneous wall enhancement of the terminal segment of the ICA and proximal A1 and M1 segments on the left, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Acute ischemic stroke due to vasculitis or vasculopathy
2. CNS vasculitis secondary to an infectious etiology (e.g., herpes zoster vasculopathy)
3. Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD)
4. CNS lymphoma with secondary vascular involvement
5. Moyamoya disease or Moyamoya syndrome

The imaging findings suggest an acute ischemic stroke with vessel wall changes that could be due to vasculitis, vasculopathy, or atherosclerotic disease. Given the patient's history of CLL and herpes zoster, an infectious or malignant etiology for vasculitis should be considered.

Confidence Level: 90%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12062018/tab-legends, which describe bilateral, symmetric choroidal thickening, and retinal detachment with abnormal choroidal enhancement on post-contrast images, and the brain being unremarkable except for small, non-specific periventricular white matter high T2W signal foci, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease
2. Uveal effusion syndrome
3. Posterior scleritis
4. Infectious retinitis (e.g., syphilis, tuberculosis)
5. Inflammatory conditions (e.g., sarcoidosis, lupus)

The presence of lymphocytic pleocytosis in the CSF, negative meningoencephalitis viral panel, and gram stains, along with the imaging findings, suggest an inflammatory or autoimmune etiology rather than an infectious one.

Confidence Level: 85%

The revised differential diagnosis is more focused on inflammatory and autoimmune conditions that can cause choroidal thickening and retinal detachment, as well as central nervous system involvement.

2017,Anterior Sacral Meningocele Related to Marfan Syndrome,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04272017), we have a case of a 29-year-old man with a history of Marfan syndrome who is experiencing progressively worsening middle back pain that radiates down his spine after a fall. Given this clinical scenario, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Aortic dissection: Marfan syndrome patients are at increased risk for aortic dissection, which can present with back pain.
2. Dural ectasia: A common feature in Marfan syndrome that can cause lower back pain.
3. Vertebral fracture: The fall could have resulted in a fracture, especially given the potential for weakened connective tissue in Marfan syndrome.
4. Spinal cord injury: Trauma from the fall could have caused an injury to the spinal cord.
5. Disc herniation: The trauma might have led to a herniated disc, which can cause back pain and radiculopathy.

After reviewing the additional information from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04272017/tab-legends), which includes imaging findings, the differential diagnoses should be revised as follows:

1. Dural ectasia with Naborsf type II meningeal cysts: The imaging shows pronounced lumbosacral dural ectasia associated with Marfan syndrome and the formation of large Naborsf type II meningeal cysts.
2. Pelvic mass: The presence of an opacity in the pelvis suggestive of a mass on the scoliosis study.
3. Scoliosis: Severe scoliosis is noted, which could contribute to the patient's symptoms.
4. Sacral foramina cystic mass: A large cystic mass originating from the left S1 sacral foramina is identified on the CT angiograms.
5. Noncommunicating cysts: The presence of two separate, noncommunicating cysts protruding through the S1 foramina.

Given the imaging findings and the patient's history of Marfan syndrome, the most likely diagnosis is dural ectasia with Naborsf type II meningeal cysts, which is consistent with the patient's clinical presentation and the imaging findings. The confidence level in this revised diagnosis is high, around 90-95%, as the imaging findings are quite specific and correlate well with the patient's symptoms and medical history.",90,Good
2017,Arachnoiditis Ossificans,"Based on the clinical history provided in the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07132017), a 53-year-old patient with chronic, severe lower back pain and associated numbness in both lower extremities, and a surgical history of posterior fusion and laminectomy at L4-L5 and L5-S1 complicated by postoperative infection and CSF leak, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS): Chronic pain following spine surgery, possibly due to scar tissue, residual spinal stenosis, or recurrent disc herniation.
2. Arachnoiditis: Inflammation of the arachnoid layer of the meninges, which can be a complication of surgery or infection.
3. Epidural fibrosis: Scar tissue formation around the spinal nerve roots, which can cause persistent pain after spine surgery.
4. Recurrent disc herniation: Re-herniation at the site of previous surgery could cause similar symptoms.
5. Spinal stenosis: Narrowing of the spinal canal, which may persist or worsen after surgery.

After reviewing the additional information from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07132017/tab-legends), which includes imaging findings of calcification within the central canal extending from L4-S1, both along the dura and intradural encasing descending nerve roots, the differential diagnoses should be revised as follows:

1. Arachnoiditis ossificans: Calcification within the arachnoid layer, which can occur after surgery, infection, or inflammation.
2. Epidural fibrosis with calcification: Scar tissue with calcification that can compress nerve roots and cause pain.
3. Spinal meningioma with calcification: Although less common, a calcified meningioma could present similarly.
4. Postoperative pseudomeningocele with calcification: A collection of CSF that has calcified over time due to chronicity.
5. Calcified chronic hematoma: A hematoma that has undergone calcification over time, potentially due to previous surgeries or infection.

Given the history of multiple surgeries, postoperative complications, and the imaging findings of calcification, the most likely diagnosis is arachnoiditis ossificans. The confidence level in this revised diagnosis is around 80-90%, as the imaging findings are quite specific and correlate well with the patient's surgical and complication history.

1. Hypertensive encephalopathy: Severe hypertension can lead to a state of cerebral hyperperfusion and vasogenic edema.
2. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES): Characterized by headache, seizures, and visual disturbances, often associated with hypertension.
3. Cerebral infarction: Acute neurological symptoms could be due to ischemic stroke, which can be related to hypertension.
4. Intracranial hemorrhage: Severe hypertension increases the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.
5. Renal encephalopathy: Acute renal failure can lead to a buildup of toxins affecting the brain, causing encephalopathy.

After reviewing the imaging findings described in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12212017/tab-legends), which include T1 hypointensity and T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity involving multiple areas of the brain and spinal cord with complete resolution on follow-up imaging, the differential diagnoses should be revised as follows:

1. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES): The reversibility of imaging findings is characteristic of PRES.
2. Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS): Can present with similar imaging findings and is often associated with severe headaches and hypertension.
3. Multiple sclerosis (MS): Can cause similar imaging findings, but the rapid resolution is atypical for MS.
4. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM): Typically presents with multifocal neurological symptoms and may show rapid improvement.
5. Infectious or inflammatory processes: Such as encephalitis or myelitis, which can have a variable course and may show resolution with treatment.

Given the reversibility of the imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is PRES or RCVS. The confidence level in this revised diagnosis is around 85-95%, as the imaging findings and clinical presentation are highly suggestive of these conditions, and the reversibility upon follow-up imaging is a key feature. However, without direct visualization of the images and further clinical details, there is still a small margin of uncertainty.",85,Excellent
2017,Beta-Propeller Protein-Associated Neurodegeneration (BPAN),"Based on the clinical history of a 33-year-old woman with a history of global developmental delay, generalized seizures in childhood, and the onset of parkinsonian symptoms at the age of 21, which progressed over 4 years, as provided in the content from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06152017), here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Parkinson's disease: Early onset of parkinsonian symptoms such as rigidity and unsteady gait.
2. Wilson's disease: A disorder of copper metabolism that can present with neurological and psychiatric symptoms, including parkinsonism.
3. Multiple system atrophy (MSA): A progressive neurodegenerative disorder that can present with parkinsonian features and autonomic dysfunction.
4. Juvenile Huntington's disease: An inherited condition that can present with parkinsonism, seizures, and cognitive decline.
5. Mitochondrial disorders: Such as Leigh syndrome, which can present with developmental delay, seizures, and motor symptoms.

After reviewing the imaging findings described in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06152017/tab-legends), which include hypointensity in bilateral substantia nigra and globus pallidi on T2 and SWI, with corresponding hyperintensity on T1 images and a hyperintense halo surrounding a hypointense linear streak in bilateral substantia nigra, the differential diagnoses should be revised as follows:

1. Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA): The imaging findings are characteristic of iron deposition disorders, such as pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN).
2. Wilson's disease: Can also present with T2 hypointensity due to copper deposition, but the imaging pattern is less typical.
3. Carbon monoxide poisoning: Can lead to bilateral globus pallidus lesions, but the clinical history is not suggestive.
4. Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome: Now classified under NBIA, presents with iron accumulation in the basal ganglia.
5. Certain mitochondrial cytopathies: Some mitochondrial disorders can present with similar imaging findings, but are less likely given the specific pattern.

Given the specific imaging findings and the clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is a form of Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA), specifically pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), which is consistent with the 'eye of the tiger' sign on MRI. The confidence level in this revised diagnosis is around 90-95%, as the imaging findings are quite specific for this condition. However, without direct visualization of the images and further clinical correlation, there remains a degree of uncertainty.",90,Good
2017,Bilateral Temporal Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis,"Based on the clinical presentation of a previously healthy 2-year-old girl with postauricular inflammatory signs, progressive worsening of otorrhea, thrombocythemia, and an elevated C-reactive protein, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Acute mastoiditis: Infection of the mastoid bone, often secondary to otitis media.
2. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH): A disorder that can cause lytic bone lesions and systemic symptoms.
3. Osteomyelitis: Infection of the bone that can cause osteolytic lesions and systemic inflammatory response.
4. Malignancy: Such as neuroblastoma or leukemia, which can present with bone lesions and systemic symptoms.
5. Benign bone tumors: Such as fibrous dysplasia or enchondroma, which can cause bone lesions.

After reviewing the imaging findings from the content provided (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05112017/tab-legends), which include large bilateral temporal bone osteolytic lesions with narrow transition zones and scalloping of the margins, sparing of the bone labyrinth, lesions isointense on T1WI and showing diffuse solid enhancement on postcontrast T1WI, and normal signal of the membranous labyrinth on T2WI, the differential diagnoses should be revised as follows:

1. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH): The osteolytic lesions and systemic symptoms could be consistent with LCH.
2. Eosinophilic granuloma: A form of LCH that typically presents with osteolytic lesions, often in the skull.
3. Infectious osteomyelitis: The clinical signs of inflammation and elevated CRP could suggest an infectious process, though the bilateral and symmetric nature is less typical.
4. Rhabdomyosarcoma: A malignant tumor that can present with osteolytic lesions and is more common in pediatric patients.
5. Hemangioma: A benign vascular tumor that can cause bone lesions, though less likely to present with systemic symptoms.

Given the osteolytic nature of the lesions, the systemic symptoms, and the imaging characteristics, the most likely diagnosis is Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) or a related eosinophilic granuloma. The confidence level in this revised diagnosis is around 85-90%, as the clinical and imaging findings are suggestive of these conditions. However, without direct visualization of the images, histopathological confirmation, and further clinical details, there is still a degree of uncertainty.",85,Excellent
2017,Candida Microabscess,"Based on the clinical presentation of a preterm infant (32nd day of life) with fever and seizures, as provided in the content from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04132017), here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Neonatal sepsis: A systemic infection that can present with fever and seizures in a preterm infant.
2. Intracranial hemorrhage: Common in preterm infants, which can present with seizures and neurological deficits.
3. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy: Due to perinatal asphyxia, which can lead to seizures and altered mental status.
4. Neonatal meningitis: Infection of the meninges, which can cause fever, seizures, and altered neurological status.
5. Congenital CNS infections: Such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), or toxoplasmosis, which can present with seizures and systemic signs of infection.

After reviewing the imaging findings described in the content from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04132017/tab-legends), which include ill-defined nodular hyperintense bilateral white matter subcortical lesions on FLAIR, slightly hypointense on T2WI, hyperintense on precontrast T1WI without any blooming on SWI, and more nodular enhancing lesions involving the basal ganglia, subcortical white matter, and deep white matter on postcontrast T1WI, with an umbilical vein catheter tip culture that grew Candida albicans, the differential diagnoses should be revised as follows:

1. Neonatal candidiasis: The growth of Candida albicans from the catheter tip culture and the presence of enhancing brain lesions are highly suggestive of disseminated candidiasis.
2. Neonatal sepsis with CNS involvement: The fever and seizures could be part of a broader systemic infection that includes the CNS.
3. Neonatal meningitis: While bacterial causes are more common, fungal meningitis can occur, especially in the setting of prematurity and invasive procedures.
4. Congenital CNS infections: Though less likely given the culture results, congenital infections can have similar presentations and should be considered.
5. Immune-mediated encephalitis: Rare in neonates, but can present with seizures and white matter changes on imaging.

Given the imaging findings, clinical presentation, and positive culture for Candida albicans, the most likely diagnosis is neonatal candidiasis with CNS involvement. The confidence level in this revised diagnosis is around 95-100%, as the evidence strongly points to a disseminated fungal infection, which is consistent with the imaging findings and the patient's clinical status. However, without direct visualization of the images and additional clinical information, there is always a small margin of uncertainty.",95,Excellent
2017,Central Giant Cell Granuloma of the Mandible,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 9-year-old boy with a right jaw mass/cyst that appeared 3 months after a tooth extraction and has been increasing in size, accompanied by dysphagia, as provided in the content from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05252017), here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Odontogenic cyst or tumor: Such as a dentigerous cyst or ameloblastoma, which can arise following tooth extraction.
2. Osteomyelitis: Infection of the jawbone, which can occur post-dental procedures.
3. Giant cell granuloma: A benign lesion that can cause jaw expansion and tooth displacement.
4. Ewing sarcoma: A malignant bone tumor that can present with rapid growth and destruction of the jaw.
5. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH): Can cause lytic bone lesions and swelling in the jaw.

After reviewing the imaging findings described in the content from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05252017/tab-legends), which include an aggressively appearing, expansile lytic mass involving the right mandibular body extending across the midline, extensive cortical destruction, root resorption and displacement of multiple mandibular teeth, granular internal septa, multiloculated cystic and solid mass with fluid-fluid levels, T2 hyperintense solid components with hypointense internal septations, and avid contrast enhancement of the solid component, the differential diagnoses should be revised as follows:

1. Ameloblastoma: Known for aggressive behavior, bone destruction, and mixed cystic-solid appearance.
2. Odontogenic myxoma: A benign tumor with aggressive growth, cortical destruction, and a multiloculated appearance.
3. Central giant cell granuloma: Can present with an expansile, multiloculated radiolucent lesion.
4. Ewing sarcoma/PNET: Aggressive malignant tumor with bone destruction and soft tissue extension.
5. Osteosarcoma: Malignant bone tumor that can present with aggressive growth, bone destruction, and a mixed lytic-sclerotic appearance.

Given the aggressive nature of the lesion, the presence of both cystic and solid components, and the extensive involvement of the mandible, the most likely diagnosis is an aggressive odontogenic tumor, such as ameloblastoma or odontogenic myxoma. The confidence level in this revised diagnosis is around 80-90%, as the imaging findings are quite characteristic of these entities. However, the definitive diagnosis would require histopathological examination. Without direct visualization of the images and additional clinical information, there is always a small margin of uncertainty.",80,Excellent
2017,Cerebral Amyloidoma Associated with B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 70-year-old man experiencing difficulty with articulating language and spoken object naming over the last month, as provided in the content from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11022017), here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Stroke: An ischemic event, particularly in the language areas of the brain, could cause acute language disturbances.
2. Primary brain tumor: Such as glioma, which can present with progressive neurological deficits including language impairment.
3. Metastatic brain tumor: Secondary lesions from a primary cancer elsewhere in the body can cause similar symptoms.
4. Dementia: Progressive neurological diseases like Alzheimer's can present with language difficulties.
5. Inflammatory or infectious process: Conditions such as encephalitis or abscess can cause focal neurological symptoms.

After reviewing the imaging findings described in the content from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11022017/tab-legends), which include an irregular and heterogeneous enhancing lesion without edema, necrosis, or mass effect, no diffusion restriction on diffusion MRI, an elevation of choline with a reduction of N-acetyl-aspartate on MRS, and a low rCBV on perfusion MRI, the differential diagnoses should be revised as follows:

1. Low-grade glioma: The lack of edema and mass effect, along with the MRS findings, could suggest a lower-grade tumor.
2. Lymphoma: Primary CNS lymphoma can present with an enhancing lesion and may have low rCBV.
3. Demyelinating disease: Such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which can present with language deficits and enhancing lesions.
4. Non-neoplastic lesions: Such as a granuloma or demyelinating lesion, which can sometimes enhance and present with focal deficits.
5. Metastasis: Although typically associated with edema and mass effect, some metastases may present atypically.

Given the imaging characteristics, particularly the MRS findings of elevated choline and reduced N-acetyl-aspartate, and the low rCBV, the most likely diagnosis is a low-grade glioma. The confidence level in this revised diagnosis is around 70-80%, as the imaging findings are suggestive but not definitive, and other entities could potentially present with similar imaging features. A biopsy would be required for a definitive diagnosis.",70,Insufficient
2017,Cerebrofacial Arteriovenous Metameric Syndrome (CAMS) Type II,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 24-year-old man with a known vascular anomaly and recent onset of left facial and arm spasms that have worsened over the past 4 days, as provided in the content from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08242017), here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Arteriovenous malformation (AVM): A tangle of abnormal blood vessels connecting arteries and veins, which can cause seizures or spasms.
2. Cavernous malformation: A vascular lesion that can bleed and cause seizures or focal neurological deficits.
3. Venous angioma: An abnormality of the venous system that can lead to seizures if it involves the cerebral cortex.
4. Moyamoya disease: A progressive vascular disorder that can cause transient ischemic attacks or seizures.
5. Brain tumor with secondary hemorrhage: A neoplasm that bleeds could present with spasms or seizures, especially if associated with a vascular anomaly.

After reviewing the imaging findings described in the content from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08242017/tab-legends), which include abnormal increased T2 white matter signal with numerous prominent flow voids in the right hemisphere and flow voids extending to the right orbit with associated right-sided proptosis, the differential diagnoses should be revised as follows:

1. Arteriovenous malformation (AVM): The presence of numerous flow voids is highly suggestive of an AVM.
2. Dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF): Abnormal connections between arteries and veins that involve the dura mater and can present with prominent flow voids.
3. Pial arteriovenous fistula: Similar to DAVF but involves the pial vessels on the surface of the brain.
4. Carotid-cavernous fistula: The extension to the orbit and proptosis could indicate a carotid-cavernous fistula.
5. Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome (Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia): A genetic disorder that can present with multiple vascular malformations, including AVMs.

Given the imaging findings of prominent flow voids and the clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is a vascular malformation such as an AVM or a fistula, with a carotid-cavernous fistula being a strong consideration due to the orbital involvement and proptosis. The confidence level in this revised diagnosis is around 85-95%, as the described imaging features are characteristic of these conditions. However, further diagnostic workup, including angiography, would be necessary to confirm the exact nature of the vascular anomaly.",85,Good
2017,Cervical Spine Chordoma,"Based on the summary of the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11092017), a 54-year-old woman is experiencing neck pain, right arm pain, intermittent bowel incontinence, and recent onset of difficulty swallowing. Without specific imaging findings, we can list a broad range of differential diagnoses that could potentially explain these symptoms:

1. Cervical spondylosis with myelopathy
2. Cervical disc herniation with nerve root and/or spinal cord compression
3. Spinal tumor (primary or metastatic)
4. Vascular malformation (e.g., arteriovenous malformation)
5. Inflammatory or infectious process (e.g., abscess, transverse myelitis)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11092017/tab-legends), which describes a lytic mass involving the right C2 vertebral body, encasing the vertebral artery and extending into the spinal canal with cord compression, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Metastatic disease (given the lytic nature and minimal peripheral enhancement)
2. Primary bone tumor (e.g., chordoma, chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma)
3. Plasmacytoma/multiple myeloma
4. Lymphoma
5. Infection with osteomyelitis (less likely given the minimal enhancement, but cannot be completely ruled out)

The presence of a lytic mass with these characteristics in the cervical spine is highly suggestive of a neoplastic process, either primary or secondary. The minimal peripheral enhancement could indicate a less vascular tumor or a necrotic center in a more aggressive lesion.

Confidence Level: 85%

The confidence level is not 100% because, in medicine, especially in complex cases involving neoplasms, a definitive diagnosis often requires a biopsy and histopathological examination. Imaging findings can strongly suggest certain diagnoses, but they are part of a larger clinical context that includes patient history, physical examination, and additional tests such as laboratory studies.",100,Good
2017,Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT),"Based on the summary of the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09212017), we have a 13-year-old boy with a history of bilateral lower extremity weakness. Without specific imaging findings, we can list a broad range of differential diagnoses that could potentially explain these symptoms:

1. Muscular dystrophy
2. Spinal muscular atrophy
3. Guillain-Barr_ syndrome
4. Myelitis or transverse myelitis
5. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis with spinal involvement

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09212017/tab-legends), which describes multilevel enlargement of the bilateral extradural lumbar nerves between L2 and S1 with increased signal intensity, and specifically notes that the cauda equina nerve roots are not enlarged, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Schwannomatosis or neurofibromatosis
2. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP)
3. Leukemia or lymphoma with nerve root infiltration
4. Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP)
5. Tarlov cysts

The imaging findings of bilateral nerve enlargement with increased signal intensity, particularly without cauda equina enlargement, suggest a neuropathic process rather than a myopathic or systemic inflammatory process. Schwannomatosis and neurofibromatosis are conditions that can cause multiple nerve sheath tumors, which could present with the described imaging findings.

Confidence Level: 75%

The confidence level reflects the fact that while the imaging findings narrow down the differential diagnosis, there is still a need for further clinical correlation, potentially including genetic testing, nerve conduction studies, and biopsy, to reach a definitive diagnosis.",75,Insufficient
2017,CHARGE Syndrome,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01052017), we have limited clinical information about a 2-month-old infant who recently underwent upper airway surgery for choanal atresia and has tetralogy of Fallot. Given this information, we can list a broad range of differential diagnoses that could potentially be associated with these conditions:

1. CHARGE syndrome
2. 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge syndrome)
3. VACTERL association
4. Treacher Collins syndrome
5. Patau syndrome (Trisomy 13)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01052017/tab-legends), which describes a dysmorphic left pinna, bilateral coloboma, and malformation of both inner ears with hypoplastic vestibules and absent semicircular canals, while both cochleae are within normal limits, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. CHARGE syndrome
2. Treacher Collins syndrome
3. Branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome
4. Goldenhar syndrome
5. Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome

The imaging findings of ear malformations, coloboma, and the clinical history of choanal atresia and congenital heart defect (tetralogy of Fallot) are highly suggestive of syndromes that involve first and second branchial arch derivatives. CHARGE syndrome, in particular, is known for coloboma, heart defects, atresia of the choanae, and ear abnormalities, making it a strong candidate for the correct diagnosis.

Confidence Level: 90%

The confidence level is high because the combination of clinical and imaging findings aligns well with the characteristic features of CHARGE syndrome. However, it is not 100% because genetic testing is typically required to confirm the diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome and to rule out other syndromes with overlapping features.",90,Excellent
2017,Chordoid Glioma,"Based on the summary of the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07272017), a 37-year-old man is experiencing blurring of vision and occasional throbbing pain in both eyes for 1 year. Without specific imaging findings, we can list a broad range of differential diagnoses that could potentially explain these symptoms:

1. Optic neuritis
2. Pituitary adenoma
3. Meningioma
4. Craniopharyngioma
5. Glioma (e.g., optic glioma)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07272017/tab-legends), which describes a suprasellar lesion that is isointense on T1-weighted images (T1WI) and iso- to slightly hyperintense on T2-weighted images (T2WI), does not show restriction on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and demonstrates intense homogeneous enhancement, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Pituitary macroadenoma
2. Craniopharyngioma
3. Meningioma
4. Rathke's cleft cyst
5. Hypothalamic/chiasmatic glioma

The imaging characteristics of the lesion, particularly its location in the suprasellar region, its signal intensity on T1WI and T2WI, the lack of diffusion restriction, and the intense homogeneous enhancement, are suggestive of a solid and likely benign neoplastic process. Pituitary macroadenoma and craniopharyngioma are common lesions in this region that can present with these imaging features. Meningioma is also a consideration given its propensity for homogeneous enhancement, although it is less commonly located in the suprasellar region.

Confidence Level: 80%

The confidence level is relatively high because the imaging characteristics and the location of the lesion provide significant clues to the diagnosis. However, it is not 100% because, in neuroradiology, there is often overlap in the imaging appearance of different pathologies, and a definitive diagnosis may require further investigation, including potentially a biopsy or surgical resection for histopathological confirmation.",80,Insufficient
2017,Chronic Recurrent Multifocal Osteomyelitis (CRMO),"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07202017), a 10-year-old boy is experiencing several months of intermittent and progressively worsening lower back pain. Without specific imaging findings, we can list a broad range of differential diagnoses that could potentially explain these symptoms:

1. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis
2. Discitis or osteomyelitis
3. Spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis
4. Ewing sarcoma or other primary bone tumor
5. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07202017/tab-legends), which describes bilateral and symmetric mixed sclerosis, lucency, and hyperostosis of the sacral pedicles, as well as a well-circumscribed left sacral ala lytic lesion with a thin sclerotic margin, and enhancement of the sacral and posterior elements involving the left sacral ala, pedicles, epidural space, and adjacent soft tissues, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Osteoid osteoma or osteoblastoma
2. Ewing sarcoma or other primary malignant bone tumor
3. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH)
4. Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO)
5. An infectious process such as tuberculosis or fungal infection

The imaging findings suggest a process involving both bone and soft tissue, with characteristics that could be seen in both neoplastic and infectious/inflammatory conditions. The presence of a well-circumscribed lytic lesion with a sclerotic margin and the pattern of bone changes may be more suggestive of a benign neoplastic process such as osteoid osteoma or osteoblastoma, but malignant processes and inflammatory conditions cannot be ruled out without further clinical correlation and possibly biopsy.

Confidence Level: 70%

The confidence level reflects the fact that while the imaging findings provide important clues, there is still a differential that includes both neoplastic and infectious/inflammatory processes. The definitive diagnosis would likely require further investigation, including laboratory tests, possible biopsy, and correlation with clinical history and examination findings.",70,Excellent
2017,Corpus Callosum Cavernous Malformation Bleeding into the Cavum Septum Pellucidum and Causing Noncommunicating Hydrocephalus,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06222017), a 31-year-old woman is experiencing a 3-month history of headaches that occur once or twice a week, last for several hours, are not relieved by analgesics, worsen with coughing or bending forward, and are associated with vomiting. Here are five differential diagnoses based on these symptoms:

1. Migraine with or without aura
2. Tension-type headache
3. Cluster headache
4. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)
5. Secondary headache due to a mass lesion or increased intracranial pressure

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06222017/tab-legends), which describes MRI findings of a well-circumscribed area in the midline at the level of the lateral ventricles and a second lesion in the body of the corpus callosum with a ""popcorn"" appearance and signal drop-out on GRE suggesting the presence of blood products, along with transependymal CSF flow suggesting developing hydrocephalus due to outflow obstruction at the foramina of Monro, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Colloid cyst causing obstructive hydrocephalus
2. Central neurocytoma
3. Subependymoma
4. Ependymoma
5. Cavernous malformation (given the presence of blood products)

The imaging characteristics, particularly the location of the lesions and the presence of hydrocephalus, suggest an obstructive process at the level of the foramina of Monro. A colloid cyst is a common cause of such obstruction. The ""popcorn"" appearance of the second lesion with signal drop-out on GRE is suggestive of a cavernous malformation, which often contains blood products of different ages.

Confidence Level: 85%

The confidence level is relatively high because the imaging findings are characteristic of certain lesions, such as a colloid cyst and cavernous malformation. However, it is not 100% because the definitive diagnosis often requires histopathological confirmation, and other rare entities could potentially present with similar imaging features.",85,Excellent
2017,Cranial Fasciitis of Childhood,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04062017), a 13-month-old girl presents with an enlarging right forehead mass that was initially noticed after minor trauma 7 months ago. The lesion is described as solid with no bruit, skin changes, or associated inflammatory signs. Here are five differential diagnoses based on this clinical presentation:

1. Dermoid cyst
2. Encephalocele
3. Fibrous dysplasia
4. Hemangioma
5. Lymphatic malformation

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04062017/tab-legends), which describes the MRI findings of a large scalp mass isointense to gray matter on T1-weighted images (T1WI), with a heterogeneous signal on T2-weighted images (T2WI), no diffusion restriction on B-1000 diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and avid homogeneous contrast enhancement on postcontrast T1WI. CT demonstrates associated thinning of the outer table of the frontal bone. Histopathology shows loosely arranged, broad fascicles of fusiform-shaped fibroblasts and myofibroblasts upon a background of myxoid stroma with extravasated red blood cells. The differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Infantile myofibromatosis
2. Fibrous dysplasia with soft tissue component
3. Fibrosarcoma or myxofibrosarcoma
4. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH)
5. Meningioma (less likely given the patient's age and lack of intracranial involvement)

The imaging and histopathological findings suggest a fibrous or myxoid neoplasm. Infantile myofibromatosis is a possibility given the age of the patient and the histopathological description. Fibrous dysplasia could also present with thinning of the bone, but the soft tissue mass and histopathology would be less typical. Malignant tumors such as fibrosarcoma are less likely but cannot be completely excluded based on imaging alone.

Confidence Level: 80%

The confidence level is relatively high because the imaging characteristics and histopathological findings provide significant clues to the diagnosis. However, it is not 100% because the definitive diagnosis often requires a complete histopathological examination and sometimes genetic testing, especially in the case of rare pediatric tumors.",80,Excellent
2017,Crouzon Syndrome,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09072017), a 21-month-old girl presents with altered mental status and lethargy. Without specific imaging findings, here are five differential diagnoses based on these symptoms:

1. Meningitis or encephalitis
2. Intracranial hemorrhage
3. Metabolic disorder (e.g., hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance)
4. Poisoning or intoxication
5. Non-accidental trauma (child abuse)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09072017/tab-legends), which describes a Kleeblattsch_del (cloverleaf skull) configuration of the calvarium secondary to fusion of many cranial sutures, bilateral orbital proptosis, and shallow orbits, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Thanatophoric dysplasia
2. Apert syndrome
3. Crouzon syndrome
4. Pfeiffer syndrome
5. Carpenter syndrome

The imaging findings of craniosynostosis with a cloverleaf skull configuration and associated facial abnormalities are characteristic of a group of syndromes known as craniosynostosis syndromes. These conditions are typically genetic and present with premature fusion of the cranial sutures, leading to abnormal head shapes and potentially to neurological symptoms due to increased intracranial pressure.

Confidence Level: 90%

The confidence level is high because the imaging findings are quite specific for craniosynostosis syndromes, particularly those associated with a cloverleaf skull. However, it is not 100% because genetic testing and clinical correlation are necessary to distinguish between the different syndromes that can present with this phenotype.",90,Excellent

4. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)
5. Septic emboli with infarction

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05182017/tab-legends), which describes bilateral symmetrical signal abnormalities in the thalamus, pons, medulla, and corona radiata on FLAIR images, subtle diffusion restriction in the thalamus and pons on DWI, and faint areas of blooming on GRE images, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Acute necrotizing encephalopathy
2. Japanese encephalitis
3. Wernicke encephalopathy
4. Osmotic demyelination syndrome (central pontine myelinolysis)
5. Deep cerebral venous thrombosis

The imaging findings of bilateral symmetrical signal abnormalities in the thalamus and other deep brain structures, along with the clinical presentation of fever and altered consciousness, suggest an infectious or inflammatory process. Acute necrotizing encephalopathy is a consideration given the distribution of the lesions and the acute presentation. Japanese encephalitis can also present with thalamic involvement and fever. Wernicke encephalopathy is less likely without a history of malnutrition or alcohol abuse but can present with similar imaging findings.

Confidence Level: 75%

The confidence level is set at 75% because the imaging findings and clinical presentation point towards a few specific conditions, but there is still a differential that includes other infectious, inflammatory, and vascular processes. Definitive diagnosis may require further laboratory testing, including serology, CSF analysis, and possibly a biopsy.",75,Insufficient
2017,Developmental Venous Anomaly Associated with Unilateral Dystrophic Calcification of the Basal Ganglia and Thalamus,"Based on the summary of the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10052017), a 39-year-old woman experienced a sudden onset of dysarthria and left hemiparesis with symptoms resolving spontaneously in less than 24 hours. Here are five differential diagnoses based on these symptoms:

1. Transient ischemic attack (TIA)
2. Stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic)
3. Migraine with aura
4. Seizure with postictal paralysis (Todd's paralysis)
5. Multiple sclerosis (MS)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10052017/tab-legends), which describes the presence of calcifications in the pallidus, caudate nucleus, and thalamus on the right side, with no mass effect, and small enhancing vascular structures within the lentiform nucleus converging medially in a single subependymal vein, with a developmental venous anomaly (DVA) outlined on DSA draining into the thalamostriate vein and vein of Galen, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Developmental venous anomaly (DVA) with associated transient ischemic symptoms
2. Cavernous malformation with associated DVA (cavernoma)
3. Hypertensive microangiopathy with calcifications
4. Fahr's syndrome (idiopathic basal ganglia calcification)
5. Primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS)

The imaging findings of calcifications and the presence of a DVA without evidence of arterial shunting suggest a vascular anomaly, which may be incidental or related to the transient symptoms. DVAs are typically benign vascular malformations, but they can occasionally be associated with cavernous malformations, which may present with similar symptoms. The lack of mass effect and the spontaneous resolution of symptoms make a large ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke less likely.

Confidence Level: 85%

The confidence level is relatively high because the imaging findings are characteristic of a DVA, which is often an incidental finding. However, the relationship between the DVA and the patient's symptoms is not entirely clear, and other causes of transient neurological symptoms cannot be completely excluded without further clinical correlation and follow-up.",85,Excellent
2017,Dural Arteriovenous Fistula (DAVF),"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08102017), a 65-year-old man presents with a 3-month history of progressive cognitive decline and falls. Here are five differential diagnoses based on these symptoms:

1. Alzheimer's disease or other dementias
2. Vascular dementia
3. Normal pressure hydrocephalus
4. Parkinson's disease or atypical parkinsonian syndromes
5. Intracranial mass lesion (e.g., tumor, chronic subdural hematoma)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08102017/tab-legends), which describes bithalamic low attenuation and swelling indicating edema on axial non-contrast CT (NECT), vasogenic edema on axial FLAIR MRI, abnormal arterial flow signal within a dilated and tortuous supravermian vein on TOF MRA MIP 3D, and a torcular region dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) supplied by the posterior meningeal artery branches on 3D-VR reconstruction from a left vertebral artery rotational DSA, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF)
2. Venous thrombosis (e.g., deep cerebral venous thrombosis)
3. Thalamic infarct due to small vessel disease
4. Inflammatory or infectious process (e.g., encephalitis, abscess)
5. Metabolic or toxic encephalopathy

The imaging findings of bithalamic edema with an abnormal vascular flow signal and the identification of a DAVF on DSA are highly suggestive of a vascular etiology for the patient's symptoms, specifically related to the DAVF. The successful treatment with embolization and the patient's full recovery of cognitive function further support the diagnosis of a DAVF as the cause of the symptoms.

Confidence Level: 95%

The confidence level is very high because the imaging findings and clinical outcome after treatment provide strong evidence for a DAVF as the underlying cause of the patient's cognitive decline and falls. The presence of a DAVF is a rare but treatable cause of such symptoms, and the imaging findings are quite characteristic of this condition.",95,Excellent
2017,Emphysematous Supraglottitis,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05042017), a 54-year-old man presents with a 5-day history of cough, fever, and odynophagia, with laryngoscopy revealing striking inflammation of the epiglottis leading to a 50% airway narrowing. Here are five differential diagnoses based on these symptoms:

1. Acute epiglottitis
2. Bacterial tracheitis
3. Peritonsillar abscess
4. Infectious mononucleosis with secondary bacterial infection
5. Angioedema

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05042017/tab-legends), which describes marked thickening and enhancement of the left aryepiglottic fold and the epiglottis with central gas bubbles, moderate airway narrowing, and a large fluid collection with obliteration of the pre-epiglottic and superior paraglottic fat tissue, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Acute epiglottitis with abscess formation
2. Laryngeal carcinoma with secondary infection
3. Laryngeal tuberculosis
4. Deep neck space infection (e.g., retropharyngeal abscess)
5. Laryngeal papillomatosis with secondary infection

The presence of marked thickening and enhancement of the epiglottic structures, central gas bubbles, and a large fluid collection suggests an infectious process, with acute epiglottitis being a primary concern, especially given the rapid onset and the patient's symptoms. The obliteration of fat planes may indicate an abscess or a more extensive infectious process. Laryngeal carcinoma is less likely given the acute presentation but cannot be completely ruled out without further investigation.

Confidence Level: 90%

The confidence level is high because the clinical presentation and CT findings are strongly suggestive of an acute infectious process, with acute epiglottitis being the most likely diagnosis. However, the confidence is not at 100% because other diagnoses cannot be completely excluded without additional clinical correlation, laboratory findings, and potentially biopsy or further imaging.",90,Insufficient
2017,Epidural Rosai-Dorfman Disease (RDD),"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08032017), a 45-year-old man presents with a 3-month history of painless cervical lymphadenopathy, bilateral lower limb weakness, and bladder dysfunction. Here are five differential diagnoses based on these symptoms:

1. Lymphoma
2. Metastatic disease
3. Tuberculosis with Pott's disease
4. Sarcoidosis
5. Spinal cord neoplasm (e.g., astrocytoma, ependymoma)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08032017/tab-legends), which describes contrast-enhanced CT showing enlarged left axillary lymph nodes, sagittal T1WI and T2WI showing an isointense epidural lesion causing compression and anterior displacement of the spinal cord, with altered marrow signal of the posterior aspect of the adjacent vertebral body, and intense homogenous enhancement of the lesion and adjacent vertebral body bone marrow, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Metastatic spinal disease with lymphadenopathy
2. Lymphoma involving the spine and lymph nodes
3. Infectious spondylodiscitis (e.g., tuberculosis, bacterial) with epidural abscess
4. Plasmacytoma/multiple myeloma
5. Sarcoidosis with spinal involvement

The imaging findings of an epidural lesion with bone marrow signal changes and homogenous enhancement, along with enlarged lymph nodes, suggest a neoplastic process, either primary or metastatic. Lymphoma and metastatic disease are high on the list due to the presence of lymphadenopathy and spinal involvement. Infectious processes like tuberculosis could also present with similar findings, especially in endemic areas or in immunocompromised patients.

Confidence Level: 85%

The confidence level is relatively high because the imaging findings and clinical presentation point towards a few specific conditions, but there is still a differential that includes both neoplastic and infectious processes. Definitive diagnosis may require further laboratory testing, biopsy, and possibly additional imaging such as PET-CT.",85,Insufficient
2017,Ewingfs Sarcoma,"Based on the summary of the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01122017), an 8-year-old boy presents with right arm weakness and neck pain for 3 months that is worse at night. Here are five differential diagnoses based on these symptoms:

1. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis
2. Osteomyelitis with or without an associated abscess
3. Discitis
4. Neoplastic process (e.g., Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma)
5. Neuroblastoma with spinal involvement

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01122017/tab-legends), which describes a C3 compression deformity and kyphosis on sagittal CT, mixed lytic and sclerotic components involving the vertebral body and right posterior elements on axial CT, a multilevel soft tissue mass with extension medially into neural foramina and laterally into the right brachial plexus on postcontrast fat-saturated coronal T1WI, and a large epidural component that displaces the thecal sac to the left on postcontrast fat-saturated axial T1WI, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Ewing sarcoma or other primary bone tumor
2. Osteomyelitis with an associated epidural abscess
3. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH)
4. Neuroblastoma with spinal extension
5. An aggressive infectious process (e.g., tuberculosis)

The imaging findings of a vertebral compression deformity, mixed lytic and sclerotic bone lesions, and a soft tissue mass with epidural extension are suggestive of a neoplastic process, with Ewing sarcoma being a primary consideration in this age group. Osteomyelitis could also present with bone destruction and a soft tissue mass, but the presence of a multilevel mass is more suggestive of a neoplasm. LCH can cause bone lesions and soft tissue involvement, and neuroblastoma can present with spinal extension, particularly in a child.

Confidence Level: 80%

The confidence level is set at 80% because the imaging findings strongly suggest a neoplastic process, but definitive diagnosis would require histopathological confirmation. The presence of a multilevel mass with bone and soft tissue involvement narrows the differential, but other conditions cannot be completely excluded without further diagnostic workup.",80,Excellent
2017,Facial Ossifying Fibroma,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12142017), a 29-year-old woman presents with a facial bulge. Without specific imaging findings, here are five differential diagnoses based on the symptom of a facial bulge:

1. Benign odontogenic tumor (e.g., ameloblastoma, odontoma)
2. Malignant odontogenic tumor (e.g., squamous cell carcinoma)
3. Osteoma or fibrous dysplasia of the maxilla
4. Maxillary sinus mucocele or cyst
5. Soft tissue tumor (e.g., lipoma, fibroma)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12142017/tab-legends), which describes a large expansile hypodense mass centered on the right alveolar process of the maxilla with internal hyperdense foci on CT, important facial asymmetry on VR, low signal intensity with heterogeneous enhancement on coronal CE-T1 fat-sat, and low signal intensity on sagittal T2, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Ameloblastoma or other odontogenic tumors
2. Osteosarcoma of the maxilla
3. Fibrous dysplasia with secondary changes
4. Central giant cell granuloma
5. Maxillary sinus carcinoma

The imaging characteristics of an expansile mass with mixed density and heterogeneous enhancement centered on the alveolar process of the maxilla suggest a primary bone lesion, possibly of odontogenic origin. Ameloblastoma is known for being a locally aggressive benign tumor that can present with such features. Osteosarcoma should be considered given the expansile nature and presence of internal hyperdense foci, which may represent ossification. Fibrous dysplasia is another possibility, though it typically shows a ""ground-glass"" appearance on CT. Central giant cell granuloma and maxillary sinus carcinoma are less likely but included due to the location and aggressive nature of the lesion.

Confidence Level: 80%

The confidence level is set at 80% because the imaging findings provide significant clues to the diagnosis, but the overlap in imaging characteristics of maxillary lesions requires histopathological confirmation for a definitive diagnosis. The presence of a mixed density mass with aggressive features narrows the differential, but other conditions cannot be completely excluded without further diagnostic workup.",80,Insufficient
2017,Fetal Zika Infection,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04202017), a 25-year-old woman with a 34-week pregnancy presents with ventriculomegaly. Here are five differential diagnoses based on this information:

1. Congenital infection (e.g., cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis)
2. Aqueductal stenosis
3. Arnold-Chiari malformation
4. Dandy-Walker malformation
5. Intrauterine stroke or hemorrhage

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04202017/tab-legends), which describes fetal MRI findings of enlarged supratentorial subarachnoid space, white matter thinning, ventriculomegaly, subcortical calcifications, and microcephaly, and postnatal MRI and cranial ultrasound findings of microcephaly, abnormal sulcation without normal primary sulci, hypoplastic corpus callosum, and subcortical calcifications, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Congenital infection (e.g., Zika virus, cytomegalovirus)
2. Congenital cerebral dysgenesis disorders (e.g., lissencephaly, pachygyria)
3. Intrauterine stroke or hemorrhage leading to secondary hydrocephalus and brain injury
4. Genetic syndromes associated with microcephaly and brain calcifications (e.g., Aicardi-Gouti_res syndrome)
5. Metabolic disorders (e.g., congenital disorders of glycosylation)

The imaging findings of microcephaly, ventriculomegaly, abnormal sulcation, and subcortical calcifications are highly suggestive of a congenital infection, with Zika virus being a notable cause of such a constellation of findings, especially given the timing of the pregnancy and the geographic prevalence. Congenital cerebral dysgenesis disorders and genetic syndromes are also considerations due to the abnormal brain development and calcifications.

Confidence Level: 90%

The confidence level is high because the imaging findings are characteristic of a congenital infection or a genetic syndrome affecting brain development. However, it is not 100% because definitive diagnosis often requires laboratory testing for infections or genetic testing for inherited conditions. The specific pattern of brain abnormalities and calcifications provides strong clues to the underlying etiology.",90,Excellent
2017,Frontal Lobe Intraparenchymal Schwannoma,"Based on the summary of the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08172017), a 54-year-old woman presents with right-sided neck pain and a history of epilepsy. Here are five differential diagnoses based on these symptoms:

1. Cervical spondylosis
2. Meningioma
3. Cervical radiculopathy
4. Vertebral artery dissection
5. Intracranial neoplasm with secondary epilepsy

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08172017/tab-legends), which describes a lesion with predominantly low T2 signal intensity with small cysts and marked perilesional vasogenic edema, isointense to gray matter on T1 without contrast, intense homogenous enhancement with a gyral pattern on postcontrast T1, and facilitated diffusion with no restriction, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. High-grade glioma (e.g., glioblastoma multiforme)
2. Metastatic brain tumor
3. Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL)
4. Meningioma with cystic or necrotic changes
5. Infectious or demyelinating process (e.g., abscess, multiple sclerosis)

The imaging characteristics of intense homogenous enhancement with a gyral pattern and the presence of vasogenic edema are suggestive of a neoplastic process, with high-grade glioma such as glioblastoma being a primary consideration. Metastasis is also a possibility, especially with the presence of cysts and edema. PCNSL can present with homogenous enhancement but typically has restricted diffusion, which is not described in this case. Meningioma could have a similar appearance if it has cystic or necrotic changes. Infectious or demyelinating processes are less likely given the imaging pattern but cannot be completely ruled out.

Confidence Level: 80%

The confidence level is set at 80% because the imaging findings strongly suggest a neoplastic process, but definitive diagnosis would require histopathological confirmation. The presence of homogenous enhancement and perilesional edema narrows the differential, but other conditions cannot be completely excluded without further diagnostic workup.",80,Insufficient
2017,Geniculate Ganglion Schwannoma,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12072017), a 39-year-old man presents with left facial weakness. Here are five differential diagnoses based on this symptom:

1. Bell's palsy (idiopathic peripheral facial nerve palsy)
2. Acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma)
3. Ramsay Hunt syndrome (herpes zoster oticus)
4. Lyme disease
5. Tumor of the parotid gland affecting the facial nerve

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12072017/tab-legends), which describes a widened left geniculate fossa and tegmentum tympani dehiscence with the presence of soft tissue extending into the epitympanum on CT, and an extra-axial middle cranial fossa mass with cystic spaces, hemorrhagic components on SWI, and peripheral and septated internal enhancement on postgadolinium T1 MRI, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Facial nerve schwannoma
2. Cholesteatoma with secondary inflammation or infection
3. Paraganglioma (glomus tumor)
4. Meningioma with involvement of the geniculate fossa
5. Metastatic lesion to the temporal bone

The imaging findings of a widened geniculate fossa and a mass with cystic and hemorrhagic components suggest a neoplastic process involving the facial nerve, with facial nerve schwannoma being a primary consideration. Cholesteatoma could present with bone erosion and soft tissue extension but typically does not show the described enhancement pattern. Paragangliomas are vascular tumors that can show a salt-and-pepper appearance on MRI due to flow voids from high vascularity. Meningioma and metastatic lesions are less likely but included due to the mass effect and enhancement pattern.

Confidence Level: 85%

The confidence level is set at 85% because the imaging findings and surgical connection to the geniculate fossa strongly suggest a neoplastic process involving the facial nerve, with facial nerve schwannoma being the most likely diagnosis. However, the definitive diagnosis would require histopathological confirmation, and other neoplastic processes cannot be completely excluded.",85,Excellent
2017,Gobbi Syndrome,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06082017), a 34-year-old woman has a history of epilepsy since she was 4 years old, was treated for 8 years, and was seizure-free until 26 years old. She now has refractory seizures. Here are five differential diagnoses based on this clinical history:

1. Temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis
2. Focal cortical dysplasia
3. Low-grade glioma or ganglioglioma
4. Arteriovenous malformation (AVM)
5. Autoimmune encephalitis

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06082017/tab-legends), which describes bilateral abnormalities at the parietooccipital corticomedullary junctions, left greater than right, hyperintense on FLAIR T1 and FLAIR T2, hypointense on SWI magnitude, and hyperintense on SWI phase, with no enhancement after contrast, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS)
2. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)
3. Cerebral vasculitis
4. Multifocal glioma or metastatic disease
5. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)

The imaging findings of bilateral parietooccipital abnormalities without contrast enhancement are suggestive of a metabolic or mitochondrial disorder such as MELAS, which can present with stroke-like episodes and seizures. PRES is also a consideration given the location and imaging characteristics, although it is typically associated with hypertension and other triggering factors. Cerebral vasculitis could cause multifocal lesions, but it usually presents with more diffuse brain involvement. Multifocal glioma or metastatic disease is less likely given the lack of enhancement. CJD is included due to the cortical involvement, although it typically presents with rapid cognitive decline.

Confidence Level: 75%

The confidence level is set at 75% because the imaging findings suggest a metabolic or mitochondrial disorder, but the differential diagnosis for bilateral parietooccipital lesions is broad, and further clinical correlation, laboratory testing, and potentially biopsy are required for a definitive diagnosis. The lack of contrast enhancement and the specific imaging pattern provide important clues but do not definitively exclude other conditions.",75,Insufficient
2017,Hypertensive Brainstem Encephalopathy,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01262017), a 27-year-old woman who is 33 weeks pregnant with preeclampsia and uncontrolled hypertension presents for evaluation. Here are five differential diagnoses based on these clinical details:

1. Eclampsia
2. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)
3. Cerebral venous thrombosis
4. Acute hypertensive encephalopathy
5. Stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01262017/tab-legends), which describes FLAIR MRI showing high signal intensity of the brainstem, focal high signal on DWI without restriction on ADC, FLAIR signal abnormality extending to the cerebral peduncles without parieto-occipital edema, and complete resolution of abnormalities on follow-up FLAIR MRI images after 8 days, 15 days, 45 days, and 1 year, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)
2. Eclampsia
3. Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS)
4. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)
5. Infectious or inflammatory brainstem encephalitis

The imaging findings of high signal intensity in the brainstem with no diffusion restriction and complete resolution on follow-up are suggestive of a reversible process. PRES is a leading consideration given the patient's history of preeclampsia and uncontrolled hypertension, which are known risk factors. Eclampsia is also a possibility, as it can present with similar imaging findings and clinical context. RCVS is included due to its association with hypertension and potential reversibility. ADEM and infectious or inflammatory encephalitis are less likely given the rapid resolution without specific treatment but are included as differential considerations for brainstem lesions.

Confidence Level: 90%

The confidence level is high because the clinical context of preeclampsia and uncontrolled hypertension, combined with the imaging findings and the reversibility of the abnormalities, strongly suggest a diagnosis of PRES or eclampsia. However, it is not 100% because the definitive diagnosis would require clinical correlation with the patient's symptoms and potentially additional diagnostic workup to rule out other causes.",90,Good
2017,Intracranial Adhesive Arachnoiditis,"Based on the summary of the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02022017), a 49-year-old right-handed woman has chronic severe headaches following a large subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) after right-sided posterior communicating artery saccular aneurysm rupture 3 years ago, which was treated with endovascular coiling. Here are five differential diagnoses based on these symptoms:

1. Chronic hydrocephalus post-SAH
2. Recurrent or residual aneurysm
3. Vasospasm-induced ischemia or infarction
4. Complications related to endovascular coiling (e.g., coil compaction or migration)
5. Arachnoid cyst or leptomeningeal cyst formation post-SAH

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02022017/tab-legends), which describes CSF loculations in the extra-axial spaces and the ventricular system on a sagittal 3D heavily T2-weighted high-resolution image, and extensive hemosiderin staining from prior subarachnoid blood products after aneurysm rupture on an axial susceptibility-weighted image, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Chronic hydrocephalus with possible trapped ventricles or loculated CSF spaces
2. Arachnoid granulations or adhesions post-SAH leading to CSF flow obstruction
3. Superficial siderosis of the central nervous system
4. Complications related to previous SAH and endovascular treatment
5. Secondary gliosis or encephalomalacia related to prior hemorrhage or ischemia

The imaging findings of CSF loculations and hemosiderin staining are indicative of complications following SAH, with chronic hydrocephalus and CSF flow obstruction being primary considerations. Superficial siderosis can occur due to hemosiderin deposition along the brain surfaces and is a potential cause of chronic headaches. Complications from the previous endovascular treatment could also contribute to the patient's symptoms.

Confidence Level: 85%

The confidence level is set at 85% because the imaging findings and the patient's history of SAH and aneurysm treatment provide significant clues to the diagnosis. However, the definitive diagnosis would require correlation with the patient's clinical course, potentially further imaging, and possibly CSF studies to confirm the presence of hydrocephalus or other complications.",85,Good
2017,Intramedullary Neurosarcoidosis,"Based on the summary of the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02092017), a 34-year-old man presents with a 3-month history of back pain, chest pain, left arm pain, and progressive left-sided numbness. Here are five differential diagnoses based on these symptoms:

1. Cervical disc herniation with radiculopathy
2. Cervical spondylosis with myelopathy
3. Spinal cord tumor (e.g., astrocytoma, ependymoma)
4. Multiple sclerosis or other demyelinating disease
5. Vascular malformation (e.g., arteriovenous malformation)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02092017/tab-legends), which describes a sagittal T2-weighted MRI showing a mildly hyperintense T2 expansile ovoid enhancing intramedullary lesion spanning from C4 to C6, associated with moderate cervical spinal cord edema, and axial contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI of the thoracic spine demonstrating mediastinal subcarinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathies, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Intramedullary spinal cord neoplasm (e.g., astrocytoma, ependymoma)
2. Sarcoidosis with neurosarcoidosis involvement
3. Lymphoma with central nervous system involvement
4. Metastatic disease with spinal cord metastasis
5. Infectious myelitis (e.g., tuberculosis, fungal infection) with systemic involvement

The imaging findings of an intramedullary spinal cord lesion with associated lymphadenopathy suggest a systemic process that involves both the spinal cord and lymph nodes. Neoplastic conditions such as lymphoma or metastatic disease are considerations, as well as granulomatous diseases like sarcoidosis. Infectious causes should also be considered, especially if there is a history of risk factors or immunocompromise.

Confidence Level: 80%

The confidence level is set at 80% because the combination of spinal cord lesion and lymphadenopathy narrows down the differential diagnosis to systemic diseases that can involve multiple organ systems. However, the definitive diagnosis would require further investigation, including laboratory tests, biopsy of the lymph nodes or spinal lesion, and potentially whole-body imaging to assess for systemic disease.",80,Excellent
2017,Intraorbital Hydatid Cyst,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11302017), a 20-year-old woman presents with orbital pain. Here are five differential diagnoses based on this symptom:

1. Orbital cellulitis
2. Optic neuritis
3. Orbital pseudotumor (idiopathic orbital inflammation)
4. Thyroid eye disease (Graves' ophthalmopathy)
5. Orbital mass (e.g., dermoid cyst, hemangioma)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11302017/tab-legends), which describes a well-defined intraorbital (extraconal) mass lesion along the superior aspect, likely within the fat, that is low on T2W FAT-SAT and FLAIR, iso on T1W with capsular enhancement, crumpled membranes within the lesion showing susceptibility, and intracranial extension, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Orbital dermoid/epidermoid cyst with rupture and inflammation
2. Lymphangioma with hemorrhage
3. Meningioma with orbital extension
4. Schwannoma with intraorbital involvement
5. Metastatic lesion with intraorbital extension

The imaging characteristics of a well-defined lesion with crumpled membranes and susceptibility suggest the presence of a cystic lesion with possible proteinaceous or hemorrhagic content, such as a dermoid or epidermoid cyst. The capsular enhancement and intracranial extension raise the possibility of a more aggressive lesion or one that has secondary inflammatory changes due to rupture. Lymphangioma is a consideration due to the potential for hemorrhage and the fat location. Meningioma and schwannoma are included due to the possibility of intracranial extension, and metastasis is considered given the patient's age and the lesion's defined characteristics.

Confidence Level: 85%

The confidence level is set at 85% because the imaging findings provide significant clues to the diagnosis, particularly the presence of crumpled membranes and the lesion's location and signal characteristics. However, the definitive diagnosis would require histopathological confirmation, and the possibility of other rare lesions cannot be completely excluded.",85,Insufficient

4. Brain tumor
5. Congenital malformation (e.g., Chiari malformation)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03302017/tab-legends), which describes a hyperdense midline cerebellar mass on non-contrast CT with surrounding edema and obstructive hydrocephalus, an avidly enhancing multinodular mass on MRI that is iso/hypointense to gray matter on T2WI with small intratumoral cysts and diffusion restriction, and biopsy findings of neoplastic tissue with round nuclei positive for neurofilaments, synaptophysin, and -catenin, and negative for GFAP, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Medulloblastoma
2. Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT)
3. Ependymoma
4. Pilocytic astrocytoma
5. Brainstem glioma

The imaging findings and biopsy results suggest a neoplastic process, with medulloblastoma being a primary consideration given the location in the cerebellum, the age of the patient, and the immunohistochemistry results. AT/RT is also a possibility due to the age of the patient and the immunohistochemistry profile. Ependymoma and pilocytic astrocytoma are included due to their occurrence in the pediatric population and potential for posterior fossa location. Brainstem glioma is less likely given the cerebellar location of the mass but is included as a differential for an infratentorial tumor.

Confidence Level: 90%

The confidence level is high because the combination of imaging characteristics, clinical presentation, and biopsy results strongly suggest a pediatric posterior fossa tumor, with medulloblastoma being the most likely diagnosis. However, it is not 100% because definitive diagnosis in pediatric brain tumors often requires a combination of imaging, surgical, and histopathological findings, and there is a possibility of other less common entities.",90,Excellent
2017,Megalencephalic Leukoencephalopathy with Subcortical Cysts (MLC) 1 in an Adult,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06292017), a 42-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia presents with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, macrocephaly, and a history of slowly progressive clumsiness and seizures between ages 6 and 16, for which no diagnosis has been made. Here are five differential diagnoses based on these symptoms:

1. Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1)
2. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)
3. Fragile X syndrome
4. Lysosomal storage diseases (e.g., metachromatic leukodystrophy)
5. Alexander disease

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06292017/tab-legends), which describes subcortical cysts in the anterior temporal poles and superior frontoparietal convexities, a cavum septum pellucidum et vergae, and extensive confluent white matter hyperintensity, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) with subependymal nodules and white matter changes
2. Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) with unidentified bright objects (UBOs) and macrocephaly
3. Lysosomal storage diseases with white matter abnormalities and cysts
4. Adult-onset leukodystrophy with neuroaxonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP)
5. Vanishing white matter disease (VWM)

The imaging findings of subcortical cysts, cavum septum pellucidum et vergae, and extensive white matter hyperintensity are suggestive of a neurocutaneous syndrome or a leukodystrophy. TSC and NF1 are considered due to the presence of cysts and white matter changes, which can be seen in these conditions. Lysosomal storage diseases and leukodystrophies such as ALSP and VWM are included due to the extensive white matter involvement.

Confidence Level: 75%

The confidence level is set at 75% because the imaging findings and clinical history suggest a genetic or metabolic disorder affecting the brain, but the definitive diagnosis would require further genetic testing, metabolic studies, and potentially biopsy. The presence of subcortical cysts and extensive white matter changes narrows the differential, but these findings can be seen in multiple conditions, and the exact diagnosis may be challenging to determine without additional information.",75,Insufficient
2017,Methanol Intoxication,"Based on the initial presentation of a 50-year-old woman with an altered state of consciousness and a history of consuming homemade alcohol, here are five differential diagnoses:

1. Methanol poisoning
2. Ethylene glycol poisoning
3. Wernicke's encephalopathy
4. Acute hepatic encephalopathy
5. Ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke

After reviewing the imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01192017/tab-legends), which describes swollen putamina with areas of high signal intensity on axial T1-weighted images, areas of low signal intensity due to early subacute blood on axial T2-weighted and T2* weighted images, and areas of restricted diffusion in the subcortical white matter of the frontal and occipital lobes and both putamina, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Methanol poisoning leading to putaminal hemorrhage and white matter injury
2. Ethylene glycol poisoning with similar findings to methanol
3. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy with basal ganglia involvement
4. Carbon monoxide poisoning with delayed leukoencephalopathy
5. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) with atypical presentation

The imaging findings of swollen putamina with hemorrhagic transformation and restricted diffusion in the white matter are highly suggestive of toxic ingestion, particularly methanol or ethylene glycol, which are known to cause such patterns of injury. These substances can be present in homemade alcohol and lead to metabolic acidosis and neurotoxicity.

Confidence Level: 95%

The confidence level is high because the clinical history of homemade alcohol consumption combined with the specific imaging findings strongly suggests toxic ingestion, with methanol poisoning being the most likely diagnosis. However, it is not 100% because definitive diagnosis would require laboratory confirmation of the toxic substance.",95,Excellent
2017,Metronidazole-Induced Encephalopathy,"Based on the initial presentation of a 51-year-old man with ataxia, vomiting, and dizziness, and a recent history of perforated diverticulitis, here are five differential diagnoses:

1. Cerebellar stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic)
2. Wernicke's encephalopathy
3. Vestibular neuritis
4. Cerebellar abscess or infectious cerebellitis
5. Metabolic encephalopathy (e.g., hepatic or uremic encephalopathy)

After reviewing the imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09282017/tab-legends), which describes bilateral symmetric hyperintense lesions in the cerebellar dentate nuclei on T2 and FLAIR images, restricted diffusion on the splenium of the corpus callosum on DWI and ADC maps, and the disappearance of previous findings on MRI one month later, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Metabolic encephalopathy (e.g., related to electrolyte imbalance, hepatic encephalopathy)
2. Marchiafava-Bignami disease (MBD)
3. Transient splenial lesion of the corpus callosum (TSLCC)
4. Wernicke's encephalopathy
5. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)

The imaging findings of bilateral symmetric lesions in the cerebellar dentate nuclei and transient restricted diffusion in the splenium of the corpus callosum are suggestive of a reversible metabolic or toxic cause. MBD is a consideration due to the involvement of the corpus callosum, although it is typically associated with chronic alcoholism. TSLCC is a transient lesion that can be seen in various metabolic, infectious, and inflammatory conditions. Wernicke's encephalopathy is included due to the patient's history of gastrointestinal issues, which could lead to thiamine deficiency. PRES is less likely given the imaging pattern but is included as a differential for reversible conditions.

Confidence Level: 85%

The confidence level is set at 85% because the imaging findings and clinical history suggest a reversible metabolic or toxic process, but the definitive diagnosis would require correlation with laboratory values, clinical course, and potentially response to treatment. The transient nature of the imaging findings and the patient's recent medical history provide important clues to the underlying etiology.",85,Insufficient
2017,Orbital Foreign Bodies,"Based on the initial presentation of a 22-year-old man with a history of trauma and a right eye laceration, here are five differential diagnoses:

1. Orbital cellulitis
2. Traumatic orbital hematoma
3. Foreign body in the orbit
4. Orbital fracture
5. Post-traumatic orbital emphysema

After reviewing the imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09142017/tab-legends), which describes a low-density area superior to the globe in the right extraconal orbit with near gas density on NECT, and lung window images showing a low-density area with geographic margins superior to the globe and surrounding pockets of gas, along with gross pathology images demonstrating small pieces of wood and plastic, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Orbital foreign body with associated infection or abscess
2. Post-traumatic orbital emphysema with foreign body
3. Orbital cellulitis secondary to penetrating trauma
4. Traumatic orbital hematoma with retained foreign material
5. Orbital fracture with pneumo-orbita and foreign body

The presence of a low-density area with gas density and geographic margins, along with the history of trauma and the gross pathology findings of wood and plastic pieces, strongly suggests the presence of a foreign body in the orbit, possibly with associated infection or abscess formation. Post-traumatic orbital emphysema is also a consideration due to the pockets of gas. Orbital cellulitis and hematoma are included due to the potential for infection and bleeding associated with penetrating trauma. An orbital fracture is possible and could lead to pneumo-orbita (air within the orbital cavity) and the introduction of foreign material.

Confidence Level: 95%

The confidence level is high because the clinical history of trauma, the imaging findings, and the gross pathology results provide strong evidence for a foreign body in the orbit with possible complications. The presence of gas and the identification of wood and plastic pieces are highly indicative of this diagnosis. However, it is not 100% because the definitive diagnosis would require surgical exploration and removal of the foreign body, along with any necessary treatment for associated complications.",95,Excellent
2017,Papillary Tumor of the Pineal Region,"Based on the initial presentation of a 50-year-old man with the first episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizure and headache, here are five differential diagnoses:

1. Glioma (e.g., astrocytoma, glioblastoma)
2. Metastatic brain tumor
3. Meningioma
4. Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL)
5. Infectious or inflammatory process (e.g., abscess, granuloma)

After reviewing the imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06012017/tab-legends), which describes a lesion arising from the posterior commissure extending down to the middle of the cerebral aqueduct, causing obstructive hydrocephalus, and showing a hyperintense rim on T1, hyperintense signal on T2 due to a cystic component, vivid enhancement on postcontrast images, and patchy restriction on DWI and ADC map, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Pineal region tumor (e.g., pineocytoma, pineoblastoma)
2. Germinoma
3. Tectal glioma
4. Arachnoid cyst with secondary hemorrhage or infection
5. Ependymoma

The imaging characteristics of a lesion in the pineal region with cystic components, vivid enhancement, and obstructive hydrocephalus suggest a pineal region tumor such as pineocytoma or pineoblastoma. Germinoma is another important consideration given the location and age of the patient. Tectal glioma could present similarly but is less common in adults. An arachnoid cyst could potentially cause hydrocephalus if complicated by hemorrhage or infection. Ependymoma is included due to its potential to arise in the aqueduct and cause hydrocephalus.

Confidence Level: 90%

The confidence level is high because the imaging findings and location of the lesion are characteristic of a pineal region tumor, with germinoma being a strong consideration due to the patient's age and the lesion's imaging features. However, it is not 100% because the definitive diagnosis would require histopathological confirmation, and other rare entities could potentially present with similar imaging features.",90,Insufficient
2017,Pilocytic Astrocytoma,"Based on the initial presentation of a 23-year-old man with recurrent headaches associated with photophobia, a mildly unsteady gait, and intermittent tingling of the hands and feet, here are five differential diagnoses:

1. Migraine with aura
2. Multiple sclerosis
3. Cerebellar tumor (e.g., astrocytoma, hemangioblastoma)
4. Vitamin B12 deficiency or other metabolic neuropathy
5. Arnold-Chiari malformation

After reviewing the imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07062017/tab-legends), which describes an intra-axial, well-circumscribed, T2 hyperintense solid mass in the right cerebellar hemisphere with no surrounding vasogenic edema, no evidence of restricted diffusion, a small focus of susceptibility within the center of the mass due to calcification, and no enhancement post-gadolinium, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Hemangioblastoma
2. Low-grade glioma (e.g., pilocytic astrocytoma)
3. Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET)
4. Ganglioglioma
5. Cerebellar infarct (less likely due to the mass effect and calcification)

The imaging characteristics of a well-circumscribed, non-enhancing cerebellar mass with a focus of calcification and no restricted diffusion suggest a benign tumor, with hemangioblastoma being a primary consideration, especially given the patient's age and the location of the lesion. Low-grade gliomas such as pilocytic astrocytoma are also a possibility due to the imaging appearance. DNET and ganglioglioma are included as they can present with similar imaging features. A cerebellar infarct is less likely due to the presence of calcification and the lack of diffusion restriction, but it is included for completeness.

Confidence Level: 85%

The confidence level is set at 85% because the imaging findings strongly suggest a benign cerebellar tumor, with hemangioblastoma being the most likely diagnosis given the patient's age and the specific imaging features. However, it is not 100% because the definitive diagnosis would require histopathological confirmation, and other rare entities could potentially present with similar imaging features.",85,Excellent
2017,Pituitary Carcinoma,"Based on the summary of the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03022017), a 47-year-old man with a history of transphenoidal surgery and radiotherapy for the treatment of an atypical macroadenoma presents with severe photophobia and progressive headaches. Here are five differential diagnoses based on these symptoms:

1. Recurrent pituitary macroadenoma
2. Radiation necrosis
3. Meningioma
4. Metastatic disease
5. Leptomeningeal disease (e.g., carcinomatosis, infectious, inflammatory)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03022017/tab-legends), which describes new T2 isointense extra-axial lesions in the left premedullary and right perimesencephalic cistern with high T1 signal foci indicating intratumoral bleed, homogeneous enhancement of the extra-axial lesions, and blooming artifact on SWI in the right ambient cistern as well as along the surface of the brainstem, cerebellar folia, and Sylvian fissures, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Meningeal metastasis
2. Secondary neoplasms post-radiotherapy (e.g., meningioma, sarcoma)
3. Infectious or inflammatory leptomeningeal disease (e.g., meningitis, sarcoidosis)
4. Hemorrhagic pituitary macroadenoma recurrence
5. Vascular lesions with hemorrhage (e.g., cavernous malformation, dural arteriovenous fistula)

The imaging findings of extra-axial lesions with intratumoral bleed and enhancement suggest a neoplastic process, with meningeal metastasis being a primary consideration, especially given the history of an atypical macroadenoma and radiotherapy. Secondary neoplasms could arise as a result of prior radiotherapy. Infectious or inflammatory leptomeningeal diseases are included due to the enhancement pattern. Recurrence of a hemorrhagic pituitary macroadenoma is possible but less likely given the extra-axial location of the new lesions. Vascular lesions are considered due to the presence of blooming artifacts, which may indicate hemorrhage.

Confidence Level: 80%

The confidence level is set at 80% because the imaging findings and clinical history suggest a neoplastic process, but the definitive diagnosis would require further investigation, including laboratory tests, CSF analysis, and potentially biopsy. The presence of enhancement and blooming artifacts provides important clues but does not definitively exclude other conditions.",80,Insufficient
2017,Polymicrogyria/Congenital CMV,"Based on the initial presentation of a 5-month-old infant with an abnormal head ultrasound showing nonspecific echogenic foci in bilateral perisylvian regions and normal development without focal neurologic symptoms, here are five differential diagnoses:

1. Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection
2. Congenital toxoplasmosis
3. Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL)
4. Sturge-Weber syndrome (without facial port-wine stain)
5. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)

After reviewing the imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02162017/tab-legends), which describes faint T1-hyperintense periventricular punctate foci consistent with calcifications, bilateral symmetric thickened perisylvian cortex with widening of the sylvian fissure and abnormal sulcation pattern, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Congenital CMV infection with secondary calcifications and polymicrogyria
2. Congenital toxoplasmosis with similar findings to CMV
3. Polymicrogyria, possibly due to an in utero insult such as ischemia or infection
4. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) with cortical tubers
5. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD)

The imaging findings of periventricular calcifications and abnormal cortical development suggest a congenital infection such as CMV or toxoplasmosis, which can lead to polymicrogyria and calcifications. Polymicrogyria itself can have various etiologies, including genetic, ischemic, or infectious causes. TSC is included due to the potential for cortical tubers and epilepsy, although the calcifications are less typical. FCD is a consideration due to the abnormal sulcation pattern, but it usually does not present with calcifications.

Confidence Level: 85%

The confidence level is set at 85% because the imaging findings strongly suggest a congenital infection or developmental anomaly affecting the cortex, with CMV being the most likely diagnosis given the presence of calcifications and polymicrogyria. However, it is not 100% because definitive diagnosis would require further clinical correlation, laboratory testing, and potentially genetic testing to rule out other congenital or developmental conditions.",85,Excellent
2017,Posterior Fossa Pilocytic Astrocytoma without Gangliocytic Differentiation,"Based on the initial presentation of a 13-year-old teenager with dysarthria, dysphagia, and ataxic gait, here are five differential diagnoses:

1. Brainstem glioma
2. Demyelinating disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis)
3. Cerebellar medulloblastoma
4. Vascular malformation (e.g., arteriovenous malformation, cavernoma)
5. Inflammatory or infectious process (e.g., brainstem encephalitis, abscess)

After reviewing the imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11162017/tab-legends), which describes an intraaxial, exophytic, mixed solid/cystic cervicomedullary junction lesion that is predominantly high on T2WI and low on T1WI, showing patchy postcontrast enhancement with foci of signal dephasing in the walls on SWI, and no diffusion restriction, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Brainstem glioma (e.g., diffuse midline glioma, pilocytic astrocytoma)
2. Ependymoma, particularly when exophytic and arising from the fourth ventricle
3. Hemangioblastoma, given the mixed solid/cystic nature and signal dephasing
4. Cavernous malformation, due to the presence of signal dephasing on SWI
5. Metastatic disease, less likely in this age group but possible with solid/cystic characteristics

The imaging characteristics of the lesion, particularly the exophytic growth pattern, the location at the cervicomedullary junction, and the signal dephasing on SWI, suggest a vascular component or hemorrhage within the tumor, which is common in hemangioblastomas. Brainstem gliomas are also a strong consideration given the patient's age and symptoms. Ependymomas can present similarly, especially when they are exophytic. Cavernous malformations are less likely due to the enhancement pattern but are included due to SWI findings. Metastatic disease is less common in this demographic but is included as a differential for completeness.

Confidence Level: 85%

The confidence level is set at 85% because the imaging findings and clinical presentation suggest a neoplastic process at the cervicomedullary junction, with brainstem glioma and hemangioblastoma being the most likely diagnoses. However, it is not 100% because the definitive diagnosis would require histopathological confirmation, and other rare entities could potentially present with similar imaging features.",85,Excellent
2017,Posttraumatic CSF Oculorrhea Secondary to Cranio-Orbital Fistula,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11232017, the case involves a 37-year-old male bomb blast victim with right hemiplegia and drowsiness. Without specific medical imaging or detailed clinical information, I can offer a general list of five differential diagnoses for a patient with these symptoms following a bomb blast:

1. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) with cerebral contusions and hemorrhage
2. Diffuse axonal injury (DAI)
3. Penetrating head injury with retained foreign bodies (e.g., shrapnel)
4. Secondary ischemic stroke due to vascular injury or emboli
5. Post-traumatic seizure disorder or epilepsy

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional details from the diagram description provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11232017/tab-legends, which includes information about an external ventricular drain, metallic shrapnel, NG tube, dentures, bilateral anterior cerebral artery infarcts, an enucleated left eye, a comminuted fracture of the left facial bones and the roof of the left orbit, and active leakage of contrast from the left temporal horn into the middle cranial fossa and subsequently into the left orbit, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) with cerebral contusions and hemorrhage, confirmed by the presence of bilateral anterior cerebral artery infarcts and metallic shrapnel
2. Orbital and facial fractures with potential cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, as indicated by the comminuted fracture and contrast leakage on imaging
3. Penetrating head injury with retained foreign bodies (e.g., shrapnel), as evidenced by the scout image showing metallic shrapnel
4. Post-traumatic enucleation of the left eye, likely due to severe trauma from the blast
5. Vascular injury leading to stroke, supported by the imaging findings of bilateral anterior cerebral artery infarcts

Confidence Level: 90%

Please note that these differential diagnoses are based on the provided descriptions and would typically require further clinical correlation and additional diagnostic information for confirmation.",90,Insufficient
2017,Scleritis,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08312017, the case involves a 35-year-old man with left periorbital edema. Without specific clinical details, here are five differential diagnoses that could be considered for periorbital edema:

1. Orbital cellulitis
2. Preseptal cellulitis
3. Allergic reaction or angioedema
4. Orbital inflammatory syndrome (orbital pseudotumor)
5. Trauma leading to hematoma or edema

Confidence Level: 60%

After reviewing the additional details from the diagram description provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08312017/tab-legends, which includes findings from coronal and axial images of contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) through the orbits showing mild left proptosis with preseptal soft-tissue stranding, and magnified views revealing thickening and enhancement of the sclera with suprachoroid effusion, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Scleritis with secondary effusion, as indicated by the thickening and enhancement of the sclera
2. Orbital inflammatory syndrome, which can present with similar imaging findings
3. Orbital cellulitis, which may cause proptosis and soft-tissue changes, although typically more severe
4. Post-traumatic changes, if there is a history of trauma, which could explain the proptosis and soft-tissue findings
5. Orbital neoplasm, which can sometimes present with inflammation and secondary effusions

Confidence Level: 80%

These revised differential diagnoses are more specific to the imaging findings provided, but a definitive diagnosis would still require clinical correlation and possibly further investigation such as laboratory tests or biopsy.",80,Excellent

Here are five differential diagnoses that could be considered for a preauricular mass in a child:

1. Hemangioma
2. Lymphatic malformation (lymphangioma)
3. Branchial cleft cyst
4. Parotid gland neoplasm (e.g., pleomorphic adenoma, although rare in this age group)

After reviewing the additional details from the diagram description provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10192017/tab-legends, which includes CT imaging findings of a large, soft-tissue mass with bone erosion, heterogeneous appearance with areas of necrosis or cystic degeneration, and extension to multiple spaces including intracranial extension, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Rhabdomyosarcoma, given the aggressive nature of the mass and bone erosion
2. Lymphoma, which can present with a rapidly enlarging mass and can be aggressive in children
3. Infectious process with abscess formation, considering the areas of necrosis
4. Neuroblastoma, especially if there is intracranial extension and involvement of multiple spaces
5. Metastatic disease, although less common in this age group, should be considered given the extensive nature of the disease

Confidence Level: 80%

These revised differential diagnoses take into account the aggressive features and extensive involvement as described in the imaging findings. A definitive diagnosis would require further clinical evaluation, including a biopsy and possibly additional imaging studies.",80,Insufficient
2017,Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) from Ruptured Persistent Hypoglossal Artery (PHA) Aneurysm,"Based on the initial content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10262017, a 21-year-old woman experienced a sudden onset of coma before regaining consciousness about 30 minutes later, with residual symptoms including a horizontal gaze palsy and bilateral pathologic extensor plantar response. Here are five differential diagnoses that could be considered for these clinical findings:

1. Intracranial hemorrhage (e.g., subarachnoid hemorrhage)
2. Ischemic stroke
3. Brainstem lesion (e.g., demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis)
4. Infectious or inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) process (e.g., encephalitis, meningitis)
5. Metabolic or toxic encephalopathy

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional details from the diagram description provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10262017/tab-legends, which includes imaging findings of a subarachnoid hemorrhage with an aneurysmal pattern in the posterior fossa, blood in the fourth ventricle, and an aneurysm on the hypoglossal artery, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured aneurysm, specifically a hypoglossal artery aneurysm as demonstrated on imaging
2. Vascular malformation (e.g., arteriovenous malformation) with hemorrhage, although the imaging suggests an aneurysm rather than a malformation
3. Secondary effects of hemorrhage such as hydrocephalus or vasospasm leading to ischemia
4. Traumatic brain injury with secondary hemorrhage, less likely given the imaging findings of an aneurysm
5. Infectious or inflammatory processes leading to vascular complications, although the primary finding is the aneurysm

Confidence Level: 95%

The presence of the aneurysm on the hypoglossal artery and the subarachnoid hemorrhage pattern strongly suggest that the patient's symptoms are due to the ruptured aneurysm and its sequelae. The imaging findings are quite specific, which increases the confidence level in this revised differential diagnosis.",95,Excellent
2017,Thyroglossal Duct Cyst Papillary Carcinoma,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02232017, a 25-year-old woman with a history of thyroglossal duct cyst presents with a several-month history of cyst enlargement, left-sided neck swelling, fever, and weight loss. Here are five differential diagnoses that could be considered for these clinical findings:

1. Infected thyroglossal duct cyst
2. Thyroid carcinoma with nodal metastasis
3. Lymphoma
4. Branchial cleft cyst with secondary infection
5. Tuberculous lymphadenitis

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional details from the diagram description provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02232017/tab-legends, which includes ultrasound and MRI findings of a well-defined, lobulated, anechoic midline anterior cervical mass with a mural nodule, microcalcifications, and a cystic metastatic cervical lymph node, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Thyroglossal duct cyst with malignant transformation (e.g., carcinoma arising within the cyst)
2. Papillary thyroid carcinoma with cystic nodal metastasis
3. Lymphoma with cystic nodal involvement
4. Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma with a cystic component
5. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma with rapid growth and cystic degeneration

Confidence Level: 85%

The presence of a mural nodule with enhancement and microcalcifications within a thyroglossal duct cyst, along with a cystic metastatic lymph node, raises the suspicion for malignancy, particularly papillary thyroid carcinoma, which is known to metastasize to cervical lymph nodes and can present with cystic changes. The patient's history of a thyroglossal duct cyst and the imaging findings suggesting a solid component with metastatic lymphadenopathy support this revised differential diagnosis. Further evaluation, including fine-needle aspiration or biopsy, would be necessary for definitive diagnosis.",85,Excellent

1. Acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma)
2. Meniere's disease
3. Labyrinthitis
4. Otosclerosis
5. Age-related hearing loss (presbycusis)

Confidence Level: 60%

After reviewing the additional details from the diagram description provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03092017/tab-legends, which includes MRI findings of a hypointense filling defect in the left cochlear modiolus extending into the fundus of the internal auditory meatus (IAM), and a homogenously enhancing mass within the cochlea, IAM fundus, and the cochlear turns, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Intralabyrinthine schwannoma, given the location and enhancement pattern of the mass
2. Meningioma, which can also present as a homogenously enhancing mass in the IAM
3. Metastatic lesion to the cochlea and IAM, although less common
4. Cochlear otosclerosis, which can sometimes present with similar imaging features
5. Labyrinthitis ossificans, which may show enhancement and involve the cochlea and IAM

Confidence Level: 85%

The presence of a homogenously enhancing mass within the cochlea and IAM, particularly with the history of sensorineural hearing loss, suggests a neoplastic process such as an intralabyrinthine schwannoma. The specific imaging characteristics provided in the diagram description help to narrow down the differential diagnosis. Further clinical correlation and possibly a biopsy would be required for a definitive diagnosis.",85,Excellent

1. Acute ischemic stroke, particularly involving the corpus callosum and pericallosal artery territory
2. Subarachnoid hemorrhage, given the hyperdense lesion and angiographic findings
3. Intracranial hemorrhage with associated edema, possibly due to trauma or an underlying vascular anomaly
4. Cerebral venous thrombosis, which can present with variable imaging findings including hemorrhage and infarction
5. Vascular malformation (e.g., arteriovenous malformation or aneurysm) with hemorrhage or thrombosis

Confidence Level: 90%

The imaging findings suggest a vascular event, with the occlusion of the right pericallosal artery and the presence of a hyperdense lesion adjacent to the hypodense lesion in the corpus callosum being particularly indicative of an ischemic stroke with possible hemorrhagic transformation or a vascular malformation with associated hemorrhage. The presence of restricted diffusion supports the diagnosis of ischemia, and the marginal hypointense spot with blooming on T2*GRE may indicate hemosiderin from prior bleeding or a vascular anomaly. Further clinical correlation and possibly additional imaging or intervention would be required for a definitive diagnosis.",90,Good
2017,True Congenital Hemifacial Hyperplasia with Unique Intraorbital Involvement,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12282017, a 35-year-old man has a 5-year history of progressively worsening right visual acuity, blurry vision, and chronic right ear discharge. Here are five differential diagnoses that could be considered for these clinical findings:

1. Chronic otitis media with complications (e.g., cholesteatoma)
2. Benign neoplasm of the parotid gland (e.g., pleomorphic adenoma)
3. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder
4. Orbital pseudotumor or thyroid eye disease
5. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)

Confidence Level: 60%

After reviewing the additional details from the diagram description provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12282017/tab-legends, which includes imaging findings of marked hypertrophy of the right maxillary bone, zygomatic arch, greater wing of the sphenoid bone, mandible, and TMJ, enlargement of the infraorbital foramen, external auditory canal stenosis, asymmetric enlargement of the foramen ovale, foramen rotundum, pterygopalatine fossa, pterygomaxillary fissure, and inferior orbital fissure, enlargement of the right masseter muscle, subcutaneous lipomatosis with overlying skin thickening and sebaceous calcifications, lower lip and hemitongue hypertrophy with fatty infiltration, enlarged and fatty parotid gland, ocular globe enlargement, extraocular muscle enlargement, and intracranial and extracranial lipomas, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Proteus syndrome, given the asymmetric bone hypertrophy, lipomatosis, and multiple other overgrowths
2. Hemifacial hypertrophy (congenital or acquired)
3. Parry-Romberg syndrome, although typically presents with hemifacial atrophy rather than hypertrophy
4. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), considering the presence of multiple neurocutaneous manifestations
5. McCune-Albright syndrome, which can present with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia and soft tissue abnormalities

Confidence Level: 90%

The imaging findings suggest a complex syndrome with features of overgrowth affecting multiple tissues, including bone, muscle, and fat. Proteus syndrome is a strong consideration given the extensive and asymmetric nature of the abnormalities. The presence of a dermoid and lipoma also fits with a complex overgrowth syndrome. A definitive diagnosis would likely require genetic testing and further clinical evaluation.",90,Insufficient
2017,Unilateral Membranous Choanal Atresia,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03162017, a 16-year-old patient presents with left nasal occlusion, headaches, and rhinorrhea. Here are five differential diagnoses that could be considered for these clinical findings:

1. Nasal polyps
2. Chronic sinusitis with or without nasal polyposis
3. Deviated nasal septum with compensatory hypertrophy of the turbinates
4. Choanal atresia or stenosis
5. Neoplastic process, such as juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA)

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional details from the diagram description provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03162017/tab-legends, which includes CT imaging findings of lateral deviation of the vomer and narrowing of the left posterior nasal cavity, as well as occlusion of the left posterior nasal cavity, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Deviated nasal septum with associated nasal obstruction
2. Nasal polyps or antrochoanal polyp causing occlusion of the nasal cavity
3. Neoplastic process, such as juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA), particularly if there is an associated mass
4. Inverted papilloma, given the unilateral nasal obstruction and potential for bony changes
5. Foreign body causing secondary obstruction and symptoms

Confidence Level: 85%

The imaging findings of deviation of the vomer and narrowing of the nasal cavity suggest a structural cause for the patient's symptoms. The presence of occlusion in the posterior nasal cavity raises the possibility of a mass or polyp. Further clinical evaluation, including endoscopic examination and possibly biopsy, would be necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis.",85,Insufficient
2017,Unilateral Submandibular Gland Aplasia,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03232017, a 52-year-old woman presents with painless swelling in the left floor of the mouth for 6-8 months. Here are five differential diagnoses that could be considered for these clinical findings:

1. Sialadenitis (inflammation of the salivary glands)
2. Sialolithiasis (salivary gland stones)
3. Benign salivary gland tumor (e.g., pleomorphic adenoma)
4. Mucocele or ranula (mucous retention cyst)
5. Malignant salivary gland tumor (e.g., mucoepidermoid carcinoma)

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional details from the diagram description provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03232017/tab-legends, which includes imaging findings of bilateral sublingual gland hypertrophy, more pronounced on the left side, and absence of the submandibular gland in the left submandibular fossa, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Salivary gland hypertrophy, possibly due to compensatory hyperplasia in response to the absence of the submandibular gland
2. Benign lymphoepithelial lesion or benign lymphoepithelial cysts, particularly in the context of Sj_gren's syndrome or HIV
3. Salivary gland neoplasm, such as a Warthin tumor or pleomorphic adenoma, which can cause gland enlargement
4. Sialadenosis (non-inflammatory, non-neoplastic gland enlargement), which may be related to systemic conditions such as diabetes or alcoholism
5. Salivary duct obstruction leading to gland enlargement, although the absence of the submandibular gland suggests a developmental or post-surgical etiology

Confidence Level: 85%

The absence of the submandibular gland on one side is an unusual finding and suggests a congenital anomaly or prior surgical removal. The hypertrophy of the sublingual glands could be a compensatory response to the absence of the submandibular gland. The lack of pain and chronicity of the swelling are less suggestive of an acute inflammatory process and more indicative of a chronic or developmental condition. Further clinical correlation and possibly additional imaging or histopathological evaluation would be required for a definitive diagnosis.",85,Excellent
2016,Acquired Epidermoid Cyst,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03172016, a 31-year-old woman with left-sided lumbosciatica who underwent lumbar puncture during childbirth 2 years earlier presents with a case for evaluation. Here are five differential diagnoses that could be considered for these clinical findings:

1. Post-dural puncture headache with associated complications
2. Epidural hematoma
3. Spinal epidural abscess
4. Arachnoid cyst
5. Meningocele

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional details from the diagram description provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03172016/tab-legends, which includes imaging findings of a hypointense intradural extramedullary mass at L3 on T1-weighted imaging, hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging and STIR, no enhancement after gadolinium administration, and displacement and compression of the cauda equina nerve roots by the mass, as well as histology showing cyst wall lined by squamous polystratified epithelium with a layer of keratin, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Epidermoid cyst, given the lack of enhancement, hyperintensity on T2/STIR, and histological findings of squamous epithelium
2. Dermoid cyst, which can have similar imaging characteristics but typically contains fat and may enhance
3. Tarlov cyst, although these are typically perineural and not intradural
4. Arachnoid cyst, which is typically CSF intensity on all sequences and may not show the same histological findings
5. Spinal meningeal cyst, which could potentially present with similar imaging features

Confidence Level: 95%

The imaging and histological findings strongly suggest an epidermoid cyst, characterized by its intradural extramedullary location, lack of enhancement, and specific histological features. The presence of squamous epithelium and keratin is consistent with an epidermoid cyst. This diagnosis is further supported by the patient's history of lumbar puncture, which can sometimes lead to the implantation of epidermal cells within the spinal canal.",95,Excellent
2016,Acute Methotrexate-Induced Encephalopathy,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05022016, a 13-year-old boy treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia presents with weakness of the upper left limb, speech and deglutition disorders, and right-sided hemiplegia. Here are five differential diagnoses that could be considered for these clinical findings:

1. Central nervous system (CNS) relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia
2. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)
3. Cerebral infarction or stroke
4. CNS infection (e.g., abscess, encephalitis)
5. Treatment-related neurotoxicity (e.g., chemotherapy-induced leukoencephalopathy)

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the additional details from the diagram description provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05022016/tab-legends, which includes imaging findings of focal and asymmetric areas of restricted diffusion in the centrum semiovale and the precentral regions on axial DWI and ADC maps, and mild hyperintensity of the left centrum semiovale on axial FLAIR, with no enhancement after gadolinium injection, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. CNS relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with CNS involvement
2. Acute ischemic stroke, given the restricted diffusion which suggests acute infarction
3. CNS infection, such as a fungal or viral encephalitis, which can occur in immunocompromised patients
4. Immune-mediated encephalopathy, which can be associated with autoimmune conditions or post-infectious processes
5. Metabolic encephalopathy, which can occur due to treatment or underlying metabolic disturbances

Confidence Level: 85%

The imaging findings of restricted diffusion without enhancement are suggestive of an acute ischemic process, but given the patient's history of leukemia and treatment, CNS relapse or infection must also be strongly considered. The lack of enhancement makes a neoplastic process less likely, but it cannot be completely ruled out without further investigation. A comprehensive clinical evaluation, including laboratory tests and possibly lumbar puncture, would be necessary to narrow down the diagnosis.",85,Excellent
2016,Acute Retroclival Subdural Hematoma Secondary to Pituitary Apoplexy,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03032016, a 78-year-old man presents with sudden-onset severe headache and loss of vision. Here are five differential diagnoses that could be considered for these clinical findings:

1. Pituitary apoplexy
2. Subarachnoid hemorrhage
3. Acute ischemic optic neuropathy
4. Giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis)
5. Meningioma or other sellar/suprasellar mass

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the additional details from the diagram description provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03032016/tab-legends, which includes imaging findings of a mixed iso- and hypertense T1 lesion with enhancement involving the sellar/suprasellar region, and a homogenous T2-hyperintense, T1-isointense retroclival collection that does not enhance, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Pituitary macroadenoma with hemorrhage (pituitary apoplexy), given the sellar/suprasellar enhancement and patient's acute presentation
2. Craniopharyngioma, considering the location and the mixed intensity on T1
3. Rathke's cleft cyst, which can present with a similar appearance in the sellar region
4. Meningioma, although typically would show more uniform enhancement
5. Chordoma or chondrosarcoma, given the retroclival location and imaging characteristics

Confidence Level: 90%

The imaging findings suggest a lesion in the sellar/suprasellar region with a retroclival extension. The presence of a mixed intensity lesion that enhances and the acute presentation with headache and vision loss are highly suggestive of pituitary apoplexy. However, other sellar and parasellar lesions such as craniopharyngioma or Rathke's cleft cyst should also be considered. The lack of enhancement in the retroclival collection may indicate a separate process such as a cyst or fluid collection rather than a solid neoplastic mass. Further clinical correlation, laboratory evaluation, and possibly surgical intervention would be necessary for a definitive diagnosis.",90,Excellent
2016,Adult Epiglottitis,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07212016, an immunocompromised 61-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus presents with a sore throat, neck pain, and a positive rapid strep test. Here are five differential diagnoses that could be considered for these clinical findings:

1. Streptococcal pharyngitis with supraglottitis
2. Epiglottitis from other bacterial infections (e.g., Haemophilus influenzae)
3. Viral laryngitis
4. Angioedema, possibly related to her systemic lupus erythematosus or medication
5. Ludwig's angina, a severe cellulitis that affects the floor of the mouth and neck

Confidence Level: 80%

After reviewing the additional details from the diagram description provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07212016/tab-legends, which includes contrast-enhanced CT findings showing edema of the epiglottis and aryepiglottic folds with narrowing of the airway, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Acute bacterial epiglottitis, likely due to Streptococcus given the positive rapid strep test
2. Infectious laryngotracheitis, which could be bacterial or viral in origin
3. Angioedema, which can cause rapid airway narrowing and would be considered especially in the context of autoimmune disease or medication
4. Ludwig's angina, if there is involvement of the floor of the mouth and neck
5. Allergic reaction, which can cause similar swelling but would typically have a more acute onset associated with an allergen exposure

Confidence Level: 90%

The imaging findings of edema in the epiglottis and aryepiglottic folds, along with the clinical presentation and positive rapid strep test, strongly suggest an infectious etiology such as acute bacterial epiglottitis. Given the patient's immunocompromised status and history of lupus, it is important to consider both common and opportunistic infections, as well as non-infectious causes of airway compromise. Immediate management would likely include securing the airway and initiating appropriate antibiotic therapy.",90,Excellent
2016,Aggressive Spinal Hemangioma,"Based on the initial content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01112016, a 78-year-old woman presents with progressive paraparesis evolving over a period of 2 months. Here are five differential diagnoses that could be considered for these clinical findings:

1. Spinal cord compression due to degenerative spinal disease (e.g., spinal stenosis, herniated disc)
2. Spinal tumor (e.g., metastasis, primary spinal neoplasm)
3. Spinal infection (e.g., epidural abscess, vertebral osteomyelitis)
4. Inflammatory or demyelinating disease (e.g., transverse myelitis, multiple sclerosis)
5. Vascular myelopathy (e.g., spinal cord infarction)

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional details from the diagram description provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01112016/tab-legends, which includes imaging findings of a lesion involving the entire T4 vertebra with a soft tissue component causing thoracic cord compression, and the presence of the polka dot sign on axial enhanced CT images, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Hemangioma, given the typical polka dot sign on CT, which represents thickened bone trabeculae
2. Metastatic disease, which can involve the vertebrae and paravertebral space
3. Multiple myeloma or plasmacytoma, which can present with vertebral lesions and soft tissue masses
4. Lymphoma, which can cause vertebral and epidural involvement
5. Spinal cord compression secondary to a primary spinal neoplasm, such as a chordoma or chondrosarcoma

Confidence Level: 90%

The presence of the polka dot sign is highly suggestive of a vertebral hemangioma, which is a benign vascular tumor that can sometimes become aggressive and cause spinal cord compression. However, given the patient's age and the aggressive nature of the lesion, metastatic disease and myeloma must also be considered. Further clinical correlation, laboratory evaluation, and possibly a biopsy would be necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis.",90,Excellent
2016,Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04182016, a 54-year-old woman presents with progressive balance instability and headaches for 2_3 weeks. Here are five differential diagnoses that could be considered for these clinical findings:

1. Meningioma
2. Metastatic brain lesion
3. Vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma)
4. Hemangioblastoma
5. Glioma

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional details from the diagram description provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04182016/tab-legends, which includes an axial non-contrast-enhanced CT (NECT) image showing a large densely calcified mass in the right middle cranial fossa with mass effect and leftward midline shift, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Meningioma, given the location in the middle cranial fossa and the presence of dense calcifications, which are common in this type of tumor
2. Oligodendroglioma, which can present with calcifications and mass effect
3. Craniopharyngioma, especially if the calcified mass is near the sellar region
4. Chondrosarcoma or chordoma, considering the possibility of a calcified mass in the middle cranial fossa
5. Metastatic lesion with extensive calcification, although this is less common

Confidence Level: 85%

The presence of a densely calcified mass with significant mass effect and midline shift in the middle cranial fossa is highly suggestive of a meningioma, particularly in an adult patient with these symptoms. Meningiomas are known to calcify and cause local mass effect. However, other calcified neoplasms such as oligodendrogliomas and craniopharyngiomas should also be considered. Further evaluation with MRI and possibly biopsy would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",85,Excellent
2016,Aneurysmal Bone Cyst (ABC) of the Lumbar Spine,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01072016, a 15-year-old patient presents with a history of lumbar pain. Here are five differential diagnoses that could be considered for these clinical findings:

1. Osteoblastoma
2. Aneurysmal bone cyst
3. Giant cell tumor
4. Eosinophilic granuloma
5. Osteoid osteoma

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional details from the diagram description provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01072016/tab-legends, which includes MRI findings of a multiloculated, heterogeneous, expansive, high-T2 bone lesion affecting the posterior elements of L1, extending to the posterior aspect of the vertebral body through both pedicles, causing compression of the thecal sac and conus medullaris, with well-corticated margins and no accompanying bone marrow signal abnormality, and avid enhancement of the septae, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Aneurysmal bone cyst, given the multiloculated appearance and fluid levels often seen on MRI
2. Osteoblastoma, especially when presenting as an expansile, well-corticated lesion with enhancement
3. Giant cell tumor, which can occur in the spine and present with a similar expansive lesion
4. Eosinophilic granuloma (Langerhans cell histiocytosis), which can present with vertebral lesions, although less commonly multiloculated
5. Hemangioma, although typically seen in the vertebral body and less likely to be expansile

Confidence Level: 85%

The imaging characteristics of the lesion, particularly the multiloculated appearance, expansile nature, and enhancement pattern, are highly suggestive of an aneurysmal bone cyst or osteoblastoma. The well-defined margins and lack of bone marrow signal abnormality also support these diagnoses. A definitive diagnosis would likely require further investigation, including a biopsy for histopathological examination.",85,Excellent
2016,Balofs Concentric Sclerosis,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11102016, a 53-year-old patient presents with sudden onset of gait disturbance and right foot drop. Here are five differential diagnoses that could be considered for these clinical findings:

2. Multiple sclerosis (MS)
3. Brain tumor with mass effect on motor pathways
4. Lumbar disc herniation with nerve root compression
5. Peripheral neuropathy

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional details from the diagram description provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11102016/tab-legends, which includes an isolated T2/FLAIR hyperintense left parietal white matter lesion with concentric rings and a thick, peripheral, irregular enhancing rim on DWI, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Multiple sclerosis (MS), particularly tumefactive MS, given the concentric rings which may represent Balo's concentric sclerosis
2. High-grade glioma, such as glioblastoma multiforme, which can present with ring enhancement
3. Metastatic lesion, which can also show ring-like enhancement
4. Abscess, which typically has a smooth enhancing rim but can sometimes appear irregular
5. Demyelinating disease other than MS, such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)

Confidence Level: 85%

The imaging findings of a lesion with concentric rings and irregular enhancing rim are highly suggestive of a demyelinating process like tumefactive MS or Balo's concentric sclerosis. However, the differential must also include neoplastic and infectious processes due to the enhancing characteristics of the lesion. Further clinical correlation, laboratory evaluation, and possibly a biopsy would be necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis.",85,Excellent
2016,Bulbar and Spinal Cord Marburg Disease,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07142016, a 56-year-old woman presents with anuria and gait instability. Here are five differential diagnoses that could be considered for these clinical findings:

1. Spinal cord compression due to a neoplastic lesion
2. Transverse myelitis
3. Multiple sclerosis
4. Spinal cord infarction
5. Metastatic disease affecting the spinal cord

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional details from the diagram description provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07142016/tab-legends, which includes imaging findings of an ill-defined expansile high-T2 cervicomedullary lesion with mild contrast enhancement, and significant worsening of the lesion at 8 weeks involving a large segment of the cervicothoracic spinal cord and the dorsal pons with diffuse enhancement, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Neoplastic process such as primary CNS lymphoma or glioma, given the rapid progression and diffuse enhancement
2. Metastatic disease, considering the possibility of widespread involvement
3. Inflammatory or demyelinating disease such as neuromyelitis optica (NMO) or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), which can present with extensive spinal cord lesions
4. Infectious myelitis, which could be bacterial, viral, or fungal, especially in an immunocompromised host
5. Paraneoplastic syndrome, which can cause extensive CNS involvement in association with an underlying malignancy

Confidence Level: 85%

The rapid progression and extensive involvement of the cervicothoracic spinal cord and dorsal pons are concerning for an aggressive neoplastic or inflammatory process. The presence of diffuse enhancement and the expansile nature of the lesion suggest a more aggressive pathology such as lymphoma or a high-grade glioma. However, given the patient's presentation with anuria, systemic processes such as paraneoplastic syndromes or severe inflammatory conditions should also be considered. Further clinical correlation, laboratory evaluation, and possibly a biopsy would be necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis.",85,Insufficient
2016,CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy),"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04212016, a young woman presents with diplopia and vertical nystagmus. Here are five differential diagnoses that could be considered for these clinical findings:

1. Multiple sclerosis (MS)
2. Vascular etiology such as ischemic stroke or vasculitis
3. Brainstem or cerebellar tumor
4. Inflammatory or infectious process such as encephalitis or neurosarcoidosis
5. Demyelinating disease other than MS, such as neuromyelitis optica (NMO)

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional details from the diagram description provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04212016/tab-legends, which includes imaging findings of extensive white matter signal abnormality with chronic subcortical infarcts and tiny chronic microhemorrhages on SWI, sparing of the cortex, and no restricted diffusion on ADC map, with involvement of the white matter at bilateral anterior temporal poles and superior paramedian frontal lobes, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Chronic small vessel ischemic disease, given the presence of chronic subcortical infarcts and microhemorrhages
2. Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL)
3. Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS)
4. Advanced multiple sclerosis (MS), which can present with extensive white matter changes, although typically with more acute lesions
5. Susac syndrome, a rare autoimmune disease affecting the brain, retina, and inner ear

Confidence Level: 85%

The imaging findings of extensive white matter abnormalities with chronic infarcts and microhemorrhages, along with the sparing of the cortex, suggest a vascular etiology such as chronic small vessel disease or a genetic condition like CADASIL. The lack of acute restricted diffusion makes an acute ischemic event less likely. The involvement of the anterior temporal poles and superior paramedian frontal lobes is somewhat atypical for common small vessel disease, which may warrant consideration of more specific syndromes like CADASIL or Susac syndrome. Further clinical correlation, laboratory evaluation, and possibly genetic testing would be necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis.",85,Excellent
2016,Cavernous Hemangioma of the Skull,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03242016), there is an incidental finding in a 61-year-old man after head trauma. However, the specific details of the imaging findings or clinical presentation are not provided in the content summary. Therefore, without additional clinical or imaging information, it is not possible to provide a list of differential diagnoses with any degree of confidence.

After reviewing the diagram description from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03242016/tab-legends), we have more information to work with. The description mentions an intraosseous expansile osteolytic lesion with thickened trabeculae in the left frontal bone, which is isointense on T1-weighted images and shows avid enhancement after contrast administration, with a heterogeneous high signal on T2-weighted images.

Based on this imaging description, here are five differential diagnoses for the expansile osteolytic lesion:

1. Hemangioma - These are benign vascular tumors that can appear as expansile, osteolytic lesions with a characteristic ""sunburst"" pattern of trabeculation.
2. Fibrous dysplasia - A benign fibro-osseous lesion that can present as an expansile, ground-glass osteolytic lesion, often with associated trabecular thickening.
3. Metastasis - Secondary malignant lesions from cancers such as lung, breast, or prostate can present as osteolytic lesions with variable imaging characteristics.
4. Giant cell tumor - Typically benign but locally aggressive tumors that can present as expansile, osteolytic lesions, often with non-sclerotic borders.
5. Osteomyelitis - An infection of the bone that can cause osteolytic changes, though usually accompanied by other signs of infection.

After reviewing the diagram description, the differential diagnosis can be refined, but without further clinical context or the ability to view the actual images, it is challenging to assign a high confidence level. Therefore, I would assign a confidence level of 60% to the differential diagnoses provided, as they are based solely on the text description of the imaging findings without the benefit of clinical correlation or direct image review.",60,Excellent
2016,Cerebral Chagas Disease (Chagoma) in a Patient with Previously Unknown AIDS,"Based on the clinical history provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04282016), a 30-year-old Paraguayan man presents with a 3-month history of dizziness, fever, weight loss, and alterations in behavior and sleep-wake cycle. Without specific imaging findings, we can only speculate on potential diagnoses. However, given the symptoms and the geographical context (Paraguay), here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Neurocysticercosis - A parasitic infection caused by the pork tapeworm, common in Central and South America, which can present with seizures, headaches, and cognitive changes.
2. Tuberculoma - A form of tuberculosis that affects the brain, which can present with fever, weight loss, and neurological symptoms.
3. Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL) - A type of brain tumor that can present with rapidly progressive neurological deficits.
4. Brain abscess - An intracranial collection of pus, which can occur due to various infections and present with fever, headache, and focal neurological deficits.
5. Glioma - A type of brain tumor that can cause a wide range of neurological symptoms depending on its location.

After reviewing the diagram description from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04282016/tab-legends), which mentions intraxial lesions compromising the corpus callosum with significant perilesional edema, irregular rim-enhancement, and small foci of restricted diffusion, the differential diagnosis can be refined:

1. Lymphoma - Primary or secondary lymphoma can present with lesions in the corpus callosum with rim-enhancement and restricted diffusion.
2. Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) - A high-grade glioma that can present with a butterfly lesion in the corpus callosum, characterized by necrosis and rim-enhancement.
3. Metastatic disease - Multiple lesions with rim-enhancement could suggest metastases, especially if there is a known primary cancer.
4. Demyelinating disease - Such as multiple sclerosis or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), which can affect the corpus callosum and present with edema and enhancement.
5. Infectious processes - Such as abscesses or neurocysticercosis, which can show ring-enhancing lesions with surrounding edema.

Given the additional imaging information, I would assign a confidence level of 70% to the revised differential diagnoses. This confidence level reflects the consideration of the imaging characteristics and clinical presentation, but it is important to note that definitive diagnosis would require further clinical correlation, laboratory tests, and potentially biopsy.",70,Insufficient
2016,Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis,"Based on the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11172016, we have a case of a 40-year-old man with a long-standing history of epilepsy, progressive bilateral lower extremity weakness, and hyperreflexia. Without imaging findings or additional clinical details, we can propose a broad range of differential diagnoses. Here are five potential differential diagnoses:

1. Multiple sclerosis (MS) - A demyelinating disease that can present with progressive neurological deficits and hyperreflexia.
2. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) - A progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons, leading to weakness and hyperreflexia.
3. Spinal cord compression - This could be due to a tumor, abscess, or herniated disc, causing progressive weakness and hyperreflexia.
4. Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) - A group of inherited disorders that cause progressive weakness and spasticity in the lower extremities.
5. Cervical spondylotic myelopathy - Degenerative changes in the cervical spine that can compress the spinal cord, leading to weakness and hyperreflexia.

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11172016/tab-legends, which describe bilateral high signal intensity lesions in the cerebellar white matter, posterior limbs of the internal capsules, and posterior and lateral columns of the cervical cord, as well as changes consistent with post-cataract surgery and thickening of the left Achilles tendon, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Adrenoleukodystrophy/Adrenomyeloneuropathy - Given the symmetric white matter lesions and spinal cord involvement, this is a consideration.
2. B12 deficiency / Subacute combined degeneration - The posterior and lateral column involvement could be indicative of this condition.
3. Multiple sclerosis (MS) - Still a consideration given the white matter lesions, although the distribution may be atypical.
4. Leukodystrophies - A group of disorders characterized by white matter changes, which could explain the imaging findings.
5. Mitochondrial disorders - These can present with a variety of CNS and peripheral nervous system findings, including white matter changes and tendon abnormalities.

Confidence Level: 75%

The confidence levels reflect the uncertainty inherent in diagnosing complex neurological conditions without a full clinical picture and additional diagnostic tests. Further clinical correlation, laboratory testing, and perhaps genetic testing would be necessary to refine the diagnosis.",75,Insufficient
2016,Chondroid Chordoma,"Based on the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02012016, we have a case of a 27-year-old man with a 4-year history of diplopia. The imaging findings described from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02012016/tab-legends include a well-defined, lobulated, low-T1, high-T2, avidly-enhancing right clival lesion involving the right cavernous sinus and narrowing the prepontine cistern, with no diffusion restriction, abutting and displacing the right internal carotid artery without mass effect over the adjacent brain parenchyma.

Based on these imaging characteristics, here are five potential differential diagnoses:

1. Chordoma - A midline, low-T1, high-T2 lesion that typically arises from the clivus and can cause bone destruction and local invasion.
2. Chondrosarcoma - Similar to chordoma, it can arise in the clival region and has a lobulated appearance with possible bright signal on T2-weighted images.
3. Meningioma - These tumors can enhance vividly and involve the cavernous sinus, although they typically have a broad dural base and may show a dural tail sign.
4. Pituitary macroadenoma - A pituitary tumor can extend to the clivus and cavernous sinus, but it usually originates from the sella turcica.
5. Metastasis - The clivus can be a site for metastatic disease, which can present with an enhancing lesion, although it often shows diffusion restriction.

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the diagram description, which emphasizes the lack of diffusion restriction and the preservation of the flow-void of the right internal carotid artery, the differential diagnosis may be refined. The absence of diffusion restriction makes metastasis less likely, and the preservation of the carotid artery flow-void suggests that the lesion is not highly invasive.

Revised Differential Diagnosis:

1. Chordoma - Still a strong consideration given the location and imaging characteristics.
2. Chondrosarcoma - Also remains a strong possibility due to the lobulated appearance and signal characteristics.
3. Meningioma - Less likely due to the lack of a dural tail, but cannot be completely ruled out.
4. Epidermoid cyst - These can present with bright T2 signal and no diffusion restriction, but they are less likely to enhance.
5. Lymphoma - Can involve the clivus and cavernous sinus, but typically would show diffusion restriction.

Confidence Level: 80%

The confidence level is higher after the revision because the imaging characteristics described are more consistent with certain types of lesions, allowing for a more focused differential diagnosis. However, without histopathological confirmation, there remains a degree of uncertainty.",80,Good
2016,CNS Nocardiosis,"Based on the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04072016, we have an elderly man with a history of pulmonary nocardiosis presenting with imaging findings. The imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04072016/tab-legends describe a conglomerate of ring-enhancing lesions in the right thalamus with ependymal enhancement of the right lateral ventricle and markedly reduced ADC values in the cystic component of the lesion.

Given this clinical history and imaging findings, here are five potential differential diagnoses:

1. Nocardia brain abscess - Given the history of pulmonary nocardiosis, this is a strong consideration as Nocardia can disseminate to the brain.
2. Metastatic disease - Multiple ring-enhancing lesions could represent metastases, although the patient's known primary disease makes this less likely.
3. Tuberculoma - Tuberculosis can cause ring-enhancing brain lesions, especially in patients with a history of pulmonary infection.
4. Lymphoma - Primary CNS lymphoma can present with ring-enhancing lesions, although it is less common in the elderly without immunodeficiency.
5. Toxoplasmosis - This is a common cause of ring-enhancing lesions in immunocompromised patients, but less likely in this context without evidence of immunosuppression.

Confidence Level: 80%

The confidence level is relatively high due to the specific history of pulmonary nocardiosis, which strongly suggests the possibility of a Nocardia brain abscess.

After reviewing the diagram description, which emphasizes the presence of ring-enhancing lesions with reduced ADC values, the differential diagnosis can be refined. The reduced ADC values are suggestive of a high cellular content or viscous material, which is consistent with an abscess.

Revised Differential Diagnosis:

1. Nocardia brain abscess - The history and imaging findings are highly suggestive of this diagnosis.
2. Cerebral abscess due to other bacteria - While Nocardia is likely, other bacteria can cause similar imaging findings.
3. Fungal abscess - Fungal infections like Aspergillosis or Cryptococcosis can also present with ring-enhancing lesions, especially in immunocompromised patients.
4. Tuberculoma - Still a consideration, especially if the patient has a history of exposure or a positive tuberculosis test.
5. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) with necrosis - GBM can present with ring-enhancing lesions, but the patient's history makes this less likely.

Confidence Level: 90%

The confidence level is increased after considering the imaging characteristics and the patient's specific history, which strongly points towards an infectious etiology, particularly Nocardia. However, without microbiological confirmation, there is still a small degree of uncertainty.",90,Excellent
2016,CNS Whipple Disease,"Based on the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04142016, we have an 8-year-old boy with fever, neck pain, diarrhea, intermittent double vision, blurred vision, and emesis that began 2 weeks ago. A cerebellum biopsy showed only macrophages.

Given this clinical presentation, here are five potential differential diagnoses:

1. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) - A demyelinating disease of the CNS that often follows an infection or vaccination.
2. Cerebellitis - An inflammatory process of the cerebellum, which can be post-infectious or post-inflammatory.
3. Brain abscess - A localized infection within the brain tissue, which can present with fever and neurological symptoms.
4. Meningitis - Inflammation of the meninges, which can present with fever, neck pain, and various neurological symptoms.
5. Neuroinflammatory disease - Such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or neuromyelitis optica (NMO), although these are less common in this age group.

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04142016/tab-legends, which describe abnormal increased signal in the pons, left cerebellar hemisphere, right mesial temporal lobe, and left basal ganglia on FLAIR images, without significant contrast enhancement, and a focus of hyperintensity in the left caudate nucleus head with restricted diffusion on DWI, the differential diagnosis can be revised:

1. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) - The multifocal CNS involvement and recent history of infection support this diagnosis.
2. Cerebellitis - The involvement of the cerebellum and recent infection could be consistent with this diagnosis.
3. Encephalitis - Viral or post-infectious encephalitis could explain the imaging findings and clinical symptoms.
4. Mitochondrial disorder - Such as Leigh syndrome, which can present with bilateral symmetric lesions in the basal ganglia and other CNS structures.
5. Lymphoma - Primary CNS lymphoma can present with multifocal lesions, but the lack of enhancement and the patient's age make this less likely.

Confidence Level: 85%

The confidence level is increased after considering the imaging findings, which suggest a more diffuse inflammatory or infectious process rather than a focal lesion like a brain abscess. The lack of significant contrast enhancement and the presence of restricted diffusion in the left caudate nucleus are more suggestive of an inflammatory or demyelinating process. However, definitive diagnosis would require further clinical correlation and possibly additional laboratory and imaging studies.",85,Insufficient
2016,Cockayne Syndrome,"Based on the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09082016, we have a 17-year-old girl with bilateral congenital cataract, progressive slurring of speech, and weakness of all 4 limbs over the last year, with a similarly affected sibling.

Given this clinical presentation, here are five potential differential diagnoses:

1. Wilson's disease - A condition that can cause bilateral basal ganglia calcification and has neurological and psychiatric manifestations.
2. Mitochondrial disorders - Such as Kearns-Sayre syndrome, which can present with progressive external ophthalmoplegia, retinal pigmentary changes, and neurological symptoms.
3. Leukodystrophies - A group of disorders affecting the white matter, which can present with progressive neurological decline.
4. Congenital infections - Such as congenital rubella, which can cause cataracts and neurological symptoms.
5. Inherited metabolic disorders - Such as aminoacidopathies or organic acidemias, which can present with a variety of systemic and neurological symptoms.

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09082016/tab-legends, which describe symmetric dense basal ganglia calcification, bilateral dentate nucleus calcification, diffuse cerebral atrophy with diffuse white matter hyperintensity, and atrophy affecting the parietooccipital regions, the differential diagnosis can be revised:

1. Fahr's syndrome - A rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by bilateral calcifications of the basal ganglia and other brain regions.
2. Cockayne syndrome - A condition that can cause intracranial calcifications, white matter abnormalities, and features of premature aging.
3. Carbon monoxide poisoning - Chronic exposure can lead to bilateral basal ganglia calcification, but the history and sibling involvement make this less likely.
4. Hypoparathyroidism - Can cause intracranial calcifications, but other features of the case may not fit as well.
5. Inherited metabolic disorders - Still a consideration, particularly those that can lead to intracranial calcifications and progressive neurological symptoms.

Confidence Level: 80%

The confidence level is increased after considering the specific imaging findings, which are more suggestive of a genetic or metabolic disorder, especially given the presence of a similarly affected sibling. The pattern of calcifications and white matter changes, along with the systemic manifestations, help narrow down the differential diagnosis. However, further clinical correlation, laboratory testing, and possibly genetic testing would be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis.",80,Excellent
2016,Complete Labyrinthine Aplasia (CLA),"Based on the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06302016, we have a 50-year-old woman with a history of sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear. The additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06302016/tab-legends describe right petrous apex hypoplasia with the absence of inner ear structures, while the left side appears normal.

Given this clinical presentation and imaging findings, here are five potential differential diagnoses:

1. Congenital inner ear malformation - Such as Michel aplasia, which is a complete absence of the inner ear structures.
2. Vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma) - A benign tumor that can cause sensorineural hearing loss, although it would not typically result in the absence of inner ear structures.
3. Meniere's disease - A disorder of the inner ear causing hearing loss and vertigo, but it would not explain the absence of inner ear structures.
4. Labyrinthitis - Inflammation of the inner ear that can lead to hearing loss, but again, it would not account for the absence of inner ear structures.
5. Otosclerosis - A bone remodeling disorder that can affect the inner ear and cause hearing loss, but it would not typically result in the absence of inner ear structures.

Confidence Level: 60%

After reviewing the diagram description, which specifically mentions right petrous apex hypoplasia with the absence of inner ear structures, the differential diagnosis can be revised:

1. Congenital inner ear malformation - This remains a strong consideration given the absence of inner ear structures.
2. Michel aplasia - A specific type of congenital inner ear malformation that involves the complete absence of the inner ear.
3. Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection - This can lead to sensorineural hearing loss and may be associated with inner ear malformations.
4. Congenital rubella syndrome - Another congenital infection that can result in sensorineural hearing loss and inner ear abnormalities.
5. Branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome - A genetic disorder that can cause hearing loss and abnormalities in the structure of the ear, although it typically involves more than just the inner ear.

Confidence Level: 80%

The confidence level is increased after considering the specific finding of petrous apex hypoplasia and the absence of inner ear structures, which strongly suggests a congenital etiology. The differential diagnosis now focuses on conditions that can cause congenital malformations of the inner ear. However, a definitive diagnosis would likely require further clinical evaluation, including a detailed patient history, genetic testing, and possibly additional imaging studies.",80,Good
2016,Copper Deficiency Myelopathy,"Based on the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01282016, we have a 59-year-old woman with ascending bilateral lower and upper extremity weakness and paresthesias leading to abnormal gait over the course of a few months.

Given this clinical presentation, here are five potential differential diagnoses:

1. Multiple sclerosis (MS) - A demyelinating disease that can present with ascending weakness and sensory disturbances.
2. Vitamin B12 deficiency / Subacute combined degeneration (SCD) - This can cause degeneration of the dorsal columns and present with similar symptoms.
3. Spinal cord compression - Due to degenerative disc disease or other spinal pathology leading to myelopathy.
4. Guillain-Barr_ syndrome (GBS) - An acute polyneuropathy that can present with ascending weakness, although it typically does not involve the central nervous system.
5. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) - A condition that can cause progressive weakness and sensory disturbances.

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01282016/tab-legends, which describe nonspecific small T2-hyperintense lesions in the subcortical and periventricular white matter and increased T2 signal in the dorsal spinal columns at the C2_C6 levels with no evidence of cord atrophy or enhancement on postcontrast images, the differential diagnosis can be revised:

1. Subacute combined degeneration (SCD) - The involvement of the dorsal columns is highly suggestive of this condition, often related to vitamin B12 deficiency.
2. Multiple sclerosis (MS) - The brain lesions could be consistent with MS, but the spinal cord findings would be atypical.
3. Copper deficiency myelopathy - This can mimic the presentation of SCD and also involves the dorsal columns.
4. HIV myelopathy - Can cause similar spinal cord findings, but would need correlation with patient's HIV status.
5. Tabes dorsalis (neurosyphilis) - This could explain the dorsal column findings, but would require serological confirmation.

Confidence Level: 85%

The confidence level is increased after considering the specific imaging findings, which suggest a pathology involving the dorsal columns of the spinal cord. The lack of cord atrophy and enhancement points away from compressive myelopathy and inflammatory conditions like MS. Vitamin B12 deficiency leading to SCD is a strong consideration given the dorsal column signal changes and clinical presentation. Further clinical correlation and laboratory testing, including B12 and copper levels, HIV status, and syphilis serology, would be necessary to refine the diagnosis.",85,Excellent
2016,Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis (DISH) with Trans-Discal Fracture at L2-L3,"Based on the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05162016, we have a 61-year-old man who fell from a two-wheeler 5 days prior to evaluation and is now presenting with low backache.

Given this clinical scenario, here are five potential differential diagnoses:

1. Vertebral compression fracture - Commonly due to trauma, which can cause back pain, especially after a fall.
2. Lumbar strain/sprain - Soft tissue injury resulting from a fall can lead to back pain.
3. Spinal stenosis - The trauma may exacerbate pre-existing conditions such as spinal stenosis, leading to back pain.
4. Disc herniation - The fall could have caused or aggravated a herniated disc, leading to backache.
5. Osteoporotic fracture - In an elderly patient, a fall can easily lead to fractures if the bones are weakened by osteoporosis.

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05162016/tab-legends, which describe diffuse thick (flowing) anterior longitudinal ligament ossification, a linear area of increased T2 signal along the inferior L2 disco-vertebral junction and the facet joint, and fracture of a calcified interspinous ligament and inferior endplate of L2 vertebra, the differential diagnosis can be revised:

1. Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis (DISH) - The description of flowing ossification along the anterior longitudinal ligament is characteristic of DISH.
2. Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) - While the flowing ossification is more typical of DISH, AS can also present with ossification of spinal ligaments.
3. Traumatic spinal fracture - The fall could have resulted in a fracture, as indicated by the imaging findings.
4. Degenerative disc disease - The increased T2 signal at the disco-vertebral junction could be related to degenerative changes, which may be exacerbated by trauma.
5. Osteoporotic fracture - The presence of a fracture in the context of a fall raises the possibility of underlying osteoporosis, although the pattern of ossification is not typical for osteoporosis.

Confidence Level: 85%

The confidence level is increased after considering the specific imaging findings, which suggest a diagnosis of DISH, given the pattern of ossification. The presence of a fracture also indicates that trauma has contributed to the patient's symptoms. The imaging findings are quite characteristic and, along with the clinical history, help to narrow down the differential diagnosis. However, further clinical correlation and possibly additional imaging or laboratory tests would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.",85,Excellent

Without specific imaging findings or additional clinical details, here are five initial differential diagnoses to consider:

1. Meningitis (infectious or carcinomatous)
2. Central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma
3. Metastatic disease to the CNS
4. Neurosarcoidosis
5. Intracranial hemorrhage or ischemia secondary to VP shunt complications

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging details from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02292016/tab-legends, which describes postcontrast coronal T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) showing diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement, including cranial nerve VIII at the pontocerebellar angles, and other findings such as hyperintense signal around the fourth ventricle and a large heterogeneous hyperintense intradural L2_3 lesion with contrast enhancement, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Meningeal carcinomatosis
2. Infectious meningitis (bacterial, fungal, or tuberculous)
3. Neurosarcoidosis
4. CNS lymphoma
5. Secondary complications from VP shunt, such as shunt infection or malfunction

The presence of diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement and nodular enhancement in the sylvian fissure, along with the intradural lesion, suggests a process involving both the meninges and the CNS parenchyma, which could be infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic in nature.

1. Leptomeningeal disease (metastasis or carcinomatosis)
2. Recurrent/residual hemangioblastoma with leptomeningeal spread
3. Neurofibromatosis (given the nerve root and thecal sac findings)
4. Infectious or inflammatory process with CNS involvement (e.g., neurosarcoidosis, tuberculosis)

The imaging findings described include a focal indentation on the dorsal surface of the thoracic spinal cord, giving the gscalpel signh (arrows) on sagittal T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and CT myelogram. There is also increased signal within the cord on axial T2WI above the level of the indentation, and the CT myelogram shows a smooth ventral surface of the cord with opacification of the widened CSF space dorsally.

Based on this description, here are five initial differential diagnoses to consider:

1. Intradural extramedullary spinal tumor (e.g., meningioma or schwannoma)
2. Arachnoid cyst
3. Dorsal arachnoid web
4. Spinal cord herniation
5. Epidural lipomatosis

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the diagram description provided in the second link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02112016/tab-legends, which confirms the presence of the ""scalpel sign"" and the imaging characteristics, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Spinal cord herniation
2. Dorsal arachnoid web
3. Arachnoid cyst
4. Intradural extramedullary spinal tumor compressing the cord
5. Epidural hematoma or abscess causing mass effect

The ""scalpel sign"" is a specific imaging feature that is highly suggestive of spinal cord herniation, where the spinal cord is displaced and indented, typically through a dural defect. The presence of increased signal within the cord and the opacification of the widened CSF space dorsally also support this diagnosis.

2. Hypothalamic hamartoma
3. Residual or recurrent teratoma with intracranial extension
4. Developmental midline anomaly or dysgenesis
5. Secondary effects of prior surgery or congenital malformation

The imaging findings suggest a complex developmental anomaly involving the pituitary and possibly the hypothalamus, which may be associated with the patient's cleft palate and prior palatal teratoma. The presence of duplicated pituitary stalks is a rare finding and could be part of a syndromic presentation.

After reviewing the additional imaging details from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09152016/tab-legends, which describes axial T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) showing mild diffuse atrophy and diffuse white matter hyperintense signal, T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) not showing abnormal white matter signal (suggesting hypomyelination, not demyelination), and atrophy of the cerebellum and thinning of the corpus callosum, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Hypomyelinating leukodystrophy (e.g., Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, 4H leukodystrophy)
2. Cockayne syndrome
3. Adult-onset Alexander disease
4. Mitochondrial disorders (e.g., Kearns-Sayre syndrome)
5. Congenital disorders of glycosylation

5. Calcified lymph node or sialolithiasis

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging details from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11032016/tab-legends, which describes a lobulated radio-opaque sclerotic bone lesion projected over the right mandibular ramus and processes on orthopantomogram, and CT images showing a large-stalked, cauliflower-shaped lesion in the infratemporal fossa arising from the lateral pterygoid plate, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Osteochondroma or osteoma of the infratemporal fossa
2. Tumoral calcinosis
3. Parosteal osteosarcoma (low-grade)
4. Calcified pleomorphic adenoma (if arising from deep lobe of parotid)
5. Giant cell tumor (less likely due to the sclerotic nature)

2016,Giant Temporal Intradiploic Arachnoid Cyst,"Based on the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06022016, we have a 49-year-old woman with a progressive left-sided headache. The imaging findings include an expanded destructive lytic lesion within the left temporal bone with scalloped and thinned bony margins and disruption of inner and outer tables in some areas. The lesion demonstrates hypointense signal on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and no contrast enhancement, suggesting a cystic rather than solid lesion. Additionally, there is volume loss with cortical thinning and subcortical hyperintense T2 signal in the underlying left temporal lobe, suggestive of prior traumatic injury.

Here are five initial differential diagnoses to consider:

1. Cholesteatoma
2. Arachnoid cyst
3. Epidermoid cyst
4. Chronic osteomyelitis with bone destruction
5. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH)

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the diagram description provided in the second link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06022016/tab-legends, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Cholesteatoma (given the lytic bone lesion and cystic appearance)
2. Epidermoid cyst (given the lack of enhancement and T2 hyperintensity)
3. Arachnoid cyst (less likely due to bone destruction)
4. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) (can cause lytic bone lesions)
5. Metastatic lesion (less likely given the cystic nature and lack of enhancement)

The imaging characteristics of a lytic, non-enhancing, cystic lesion in the temporal bone with associated bone destruction and the clinical presentation of a progressive headache are most suggestive of a cholesteatoma or an epidermoid cyst. The history of prior traumatic injury may or may not be related to the current findings.

Confidence Level: 60%

After reviewing the additional imaging details from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11242016/tab-legends, which describes axial DWI and ADC map showing bilateral and symmetrical globus pallidus restriction diffusion, and axial and coronal T2 showing bilateral opercular hypoplasia with sylvian fissure enlargement, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Bilateral symmetrical globus pallidus lesions due to metabolic disorders (e.g., mitochondrial disorders, organic acidemias)
2. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy
3. Infectious or inflammatory conditions affecting the basal ganglia (e.g., encephalitis)
4. Genetic or developmental disorders (e.g., opercular syndrome, also known as Foix-Chavany-Marie syndrome)
5. Toxic exposure (e.g., carbon monoxide poisoning, certain medications or toxins)

The imaging findings of bilateral and symmetrical globus pallidus diffusion restriction and opercular hypoplasia with sylvian fissure enlargement suggest a metabolic or genetic syndrome that affects those specific brain regions.

After reviewing the additional imaging details from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12292016/tab-legends, which describes a noncontrast CT scan showing acute subarachnoid hemorrhage with an aneurysmal pattern, CT angiography revealing a segmental arterial narrowing of the A1 segment of the right anterior cerebral artery (stenosis), confirmed by conventional angiography, and a four-month follow-up CTA showing a focal outpouching where the segmental narrowing was first seen, in keeping with a pseudoaneurysm, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Ruptured pseudoaneurysm
2. RCVS with secondary aneurysm formation
3. Infectious or mycotic aneurysm
4. Dissecting aneurysm
5. Traumatic aneurysm

The imaging findings suggest a vascular etiology for the subarachnoid hemorrhage, with the development of a pseudoaneurysm over time at the site of the original arterial narrowing. This is consistent with a ruptured pseudoaneurysm, which can present with subarachnoid hemorrhage and may be associated with headaches, including postcoital headaches.

1. Cavernous malformation (cavernoma) of the spinal cord
2. Hemorrhagic spinal cord tumor (e.g., ependymoma, astrocytoma with hemorrhage)
3. Spinal cord arteriovenous malformation (AVM)
4. Spinal cord hematoma (e.g., subacute to chronic phase)
5. Inflammatory lesion with hemorrhage (less likely given the hemosiderin staining)

The imaging findings of a lesion with central high T2 signal intensity and peripheral hemosiderin staining, along with the marked blooming effect on GRE, are highly suggestive of a cavernous malformation. This type of lesion is known to cause recurrent microhemorrhages, which can lead to hemosiderin deposition and the blooming effect seen on GRE sequences.

1. High-grade glioma (e.g., glioblastoma multiforme)
2. Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL)
3. Metastatic brain tumor
4. Intraventricular meningioma
5. Colloid cyst with associated hydrocephalus (less likely given the enhancement pattern)

The imaging findings of a mixed-density mass with heterogeneous signal, avid enhancement, and nodular areas suggest a neoplastic process, with high-grade glioma and PCNSL being strong considerations. The presence of an intraventricular component and the patient's age may also raise the possibility of an intraventricular meningioma.

1. Lumbar disc herniation with associated perineural (Tarlov) cyst
2. Synovial cyst (ganglion cyst) associated with facet joint
3. Hemorrhagic lumbar disc herniation
4. Spinal arachnoid cyst with hemorrhage
5. Spinal epidural hematoma

The imaging and histopathological findings suggest a cystic lesion associated with the intervertebral disc, which is consistent with a disc herniation that has undergone cystic degeneration. The presence of hemosiderin-laden macrophages indicates previous hemorrhage, which could be related to a synovial cyst or hemorrhagic disc herniation.

2015,Acute Hemorrhagic Leukoencephalitis (AHLE),"Based on the clinical presentation of a 9-year-old boy with suspected ADEM (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis) and an ongoing systemic inflammatory illness for 2 weeks, as well as the imaging findings described in the content from the link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10012015), here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)
2. Multiple sclerosis (MS)
3. Infectious encephalitis (e.g., viral, bacterial)
4. Vasculitis with CNS involvement
5. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) with CNS manifestations

Confidence Level: 80% (This confidence level reflects the consideration of inflammatory and infectious conditions that can present with multifocal CNS lesions and systemic illness.)

After reviewing the additional information from the second JSON data (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10012015/tab-legends), which describes MRI findings of multiple areas of decreased T1 and increased T2 signal involving the gray and white matter in different lobes with a confluent pattern, well-defined margins, moderate mass effect, sulcal effacement, and midline shift, without enhancement, and subsequent imaging showing subacute hemorrhage within some lesions, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) (given the multifocal lesions and hemorrhagic transformation)
2. Hemorrhagic encephalitis (e.g., due to herpes simplex virus or other pathogens)
3. CNS vasculitis (considering the hemorrhagic foci and multifocal involvement)
4. Post-infectious or post-vaccination immune-mediated encephalitis
5. Mitochondrial disorder with CNS involvement (e.g., MELAS syndrome)

Confidence Level: 90% (The confidence level is increased due to the specific imaging findings of confluent multifocal lesions with hemorrhagic transformation, which are more characteristic of ADEM or hemorrhagic encephalitis, and the clinical presentation of a systemic inflammatory illness.)

The actual diagnosis would require correlation with the patient's full clinical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, including infectious disease workup and autoimmune panel, and potentially further imaging or biopsy. The confidence levels provided are estimations based on the limited information available and could change with more comprehensive data.",90,Good

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12032015/tab-legends, which describes MRI findings of bilateral high signal intensity on the globus pallidus and subthalamic nuclei on axial T1WI, and hyperintensity of the dentate nuclei and hippocampal cortex on T2WI, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that would cause these specific imaging findings in a neonate:

1. Kernicterus (bilirubin encephalopathy) - associated with jaundice and high signal intensity in the globus pallidus on T1WI.
2. Neonatal hypoglycemia - can lead to injury in the subthalamic nuclei and hippocampus.
3. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy - can cause selective injury to vulnerable brain regions.
4. Inborn errors of metabolism - certain metabolic disorders can lead to abnormal signal in these regions.
5. Mitochondrial disorders - can present with similar MRI findings and a clinical picture of lethargy and feeding difficulties.

Confidence Level: 90%

1. Chemotherapy-induced leukoencephalopathy (specifically 5-FU induced)
2. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)
3. Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS)
4. Hyperammonemic encephalopathy
5. Toxic/metabolic encephalopathy

Confidence Level: 95%

The increased confidence level reflects the additional specificity provided by the imaging findings and the temporal relationship with 5-FU infusion, which strongly suggests a diagnosis of chemotherapy-induced leukoencephalopathy. The reversibility of the imaging findings after discontinuation of the chemotherapy agent further supports this diagnosis.",95,Excellent
2015,Agenesis of the Internal Carotid Artery,"Based on the summary of the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03122015-c2, a 14-year-old boy presents with acute occipital headache, vomiting, and syncope. Here are five initial differential diagnoses:

2. Dissection of the left ICA
3. Moyamoya disease
4. Traumatic brain injury leading to vessel injury
5. Vasculitis

Confidence Level: 95%

The increased confidence level reflects the additional specificity provided by the imaging findings, which indicate a vascular cause for the patient's symptoms, most likely a subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured ACommA aneurysm, given the absence of the left ICA and the presence of an aneurysm on imaging. The absence of the left carotid canal suggests a congenital etiology rather than an acquired one.",95,Good
2015,Agenesis of the Internal Carotid Artery,"Based on the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03122015-c1, the patient is a 52-year-old woman with a 2-year history of migraine-type headaches. Here are five initial differential diagnoses:

The absence of the carotid canal suggests a congenital etiology rather than an acquired one, such as chronic occlusion or dissection.",90,Excellent
2015,Aicardi-Gouti_res Syndrome,"Based on the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12242015, a 22-month-old boy presents with developmental delay since birth, episodes of seizures, extreme irritability, and unexplained fever since the age of 18 months. The neurologic examination showed axial hypotonia, hyperreflexia, and mild microcephaly. CSF showed mild chronic lymphocytosis and normal glucose and protein levels. Here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Congenital infection (e.g., cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis)
2. Metabolic disorder (e.g., leukodystrophy, mitochondrial disorder)
3. Genetic syndrome with neurologic manifestations (e.g., Rett syndrome, Angelman syndrome)
4. Autoimmune encephalitis

2. Inherited metabolic disorders (e.g., Alexander disease, Canavan disease)
3. Mitochondrial disorders (e.g., Kearns-Sayre syndrome)
4. Inborn errors of metabolism with neurologic sequelae (e.g., glutaric aciduria type I)
5. Neurocutaneous syndromes (e.g., Sturge-Weber syndrome, tuberous sclerosis)

Confidence Level: 85%

The increased confidence level reflects the additional specificity provided by the imaging findings, which suggest a likely congenital or metabolic etiology, given the presence of brain atrophy, abnormal white matter signal, and calcifications. The clinical history and CSF findings also support a chronic process, which is consistent with these diagnoses.",85,Insufficient
2015,Arachnoid Cyst with Accessory Nerve Palsy,"Based on the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05252015, a 19-year-old man noticed asymmetry of his shoulders while shaving.

2. Septo-optic dysplasia (de Morsier syndrome)
3. Morning glory syndrome with associated midline craniofacial defects
4. Craniopharyngioma or other sellar/suprasellar tumors with secondary skull base defects
5. Congenital midline anomalies with associated endocrine dysfunction

Confidence Level: 90%

The increased confidence level reflects the additional specificity provided by the imaging findings, which suggest a congenital skull base defect with herniation of intracranial contents and a persistent craniopharyngeal canal, as well as an ocular anomaly consistent with morning glory syndrome. These findings are indicative of a complex congenital syndrome involving midline craniofacial structures and the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, which is responsible for growth hormone production.",90,Excellent
2015,Benign Notochordal Cell Tumor,"Based on the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07302015, an elderly woman presents with a 4-month history of low back pain radiating to the right leg. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for her condition:

1. Hemangioma
2. Bone island (enostosis)
3. Osteoblastic metastasis
4. Osteoid osteoma
5. Paget's disease of bone

Confidence Level: 85%

The increased confidence level reflects the additional specificity provided by the imaging findings, which suggest a benign intraosseous lesion, given the lack of enhancement, absence of soft tissue component, and the sclerotic nature on CT. Hemangioma and bone island are particularly likely given the imaging characteristics, although the clinical presentation is less typical for these benign entities. Osteoblastic metastasis is less likely due to the absence of other typical signs of malignancy, but it cannot be completely ruled out without further clinical correlation.",85,Insufficient
2015,Bisphosphonate-Associated Osteonecrosis of the Jaws,"Based on the summary of the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08202015, a 66-year-old man with known metastatic breast cancer, on Zometa (bisphosphonate) for the last 5 years, presented with difficulty opening his mouth and chewing on the left side for the last 2 months. Here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Metastatic disease to the maxilla or mandible
2. Osteonecrosis of the jaw associated with bisphosphonate therapy
3. Osteomyelitis of the jaw
4. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder
5. Primary bone tumor of the jaw (e.g., osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma)

Confidence Level: 80%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08202015/tab-legends, which describes CT scan findings of cortical destruction, osseous sclerosis, periosteal reaction, fragmentation, and sequestration involving the maxilla (more on the left side) and left maxillary sinus, along with mucosal thickening in the maxillary sinuses, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that would cause these specific imaging findings:

1. Osteonecrosis of the jaw associated with bisphosphonate therapy
2. Metastatic disease to the maxilla or mandible
3. Osteomyelitis of the jaw
4. Radiation-induced osteonecrosis (if the patient had prior radiation therapy)
5. Primary bone tumor of the jaw with secondary infection

Confidence Level: 90%

The increased confidence level reflects the additional specificity provided by the imaging findings, which are highly suggestive of osteonecrosis of the jaw, particularly given the patient's history of long-term bisphosphonate therapy. This condition, known as bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ), is a well-documented complication of bisphosphonate use. The presence of metastatic disease remains a differential consideration due to the patient's history of breast cancer, but the imaging characteristics and clinical history favor BRONJ.",90,Excellent
2015,Bone Flap Osteomyelitis with Subperiosteal Abscess,"Based on the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07062015, a 69-year-old woman with a history of right craniotomy for subdural hematoma (SDH) evacuation presents 19 months later with right periauricular soft tissue swelling. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for her condition:

1. Post-surgical changes with soft tissue swelling
2. Infection (e.g., abscess, osteomyelitis)
3. Recurrence of subdural hematoma
4. Neoplastic process (e.g., metastasis, primary bone tumor)
5. Foreign body reaction

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07062015/tab-legends, which describes a right frontoparietal craniotomy with multiple erosions of the inner and outer tables, loss of normal T1 marrow signal within the diploic space, heterogeneous enhancement within the diploe of the bone flap, subgaleal, subperiosteal, and dural enhancement, and a small nonenhancing area between the bone flap and the dura suspicious for a small epidural empyema, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that would cause these specific imaging findings:

1. Postoperative infection (e.g., osteomyelitis, epidural abscess)
2. Infected craniotomy bone flap
3. Scalp or soft tissue infection with secondary bone involvement
4. Neoplastic process with secondary infection
5. Foreign body reaction with secondary infection

Confidence Level: 90%

The increased confidence level reflects the additional specificity provided by the imaging findings, which are highly suggestive of an infectious process, given the presence of bone erosion, loss of marrow signal, and heterogeneous enhancement. The description of a small nonenhancing area between the bone flap and the dura raises concern for an epidural empyema, which is a serious condition that typically requires prompt intervention. The history of prior craniotomy and the current imaging findings strongly point towards a postoperative infectious etiology.",90,Excellent
2015,Brachial Plexitis,"Based on the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04062015, a 20-year-old man presents with sudden onset of left upper limb weakness following a recent viral upper respiratory tract illness. Here are five initial differential diagnoses:

2. Brachial plexitis (Parsonage-Turner syndrome)
3. Transverse myelitis
4. Cervical radiculopathy
5. Stroke affecting the motor cortex or corticospinal tract

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04062015/tab-legends, which describes coronal STIR and axial images demonstrating diffuse thickening and bright signal involving various portions of the left brachial plexus, and axial STIR images showing denervation changes of the left shoulder girdle, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that would cause these specific imaging findings:

1. Brachial plexitis (Parsonage-Turner syndrome)
2. Brachial plexus neuritis
3. Traumatic brachial plexopathy
4. Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP)
5. Neoplastic infiltration of the brachial plexus

Confidence Level: 90%

The increased confidence level reflects the additional specificity provided by the imaging findings, which suggest an inflammatory or immune-mediated process affecting the brachial plexus, consistent with brachial plexitis or neuritis. The recent viral illness and the acute onset of symptoms support an inflammatory etiology such as Parsonage-Turner syndrome. Trauma and neoplastic infiltration are less likely given the absence of a history of injury and the diffuse nature of the imaging findings, respectively. HNPP is a consideration but typically presents with recurrent episodes of neuropathy rather than acute onset.",90,Excellent
2015,Brain Calcification in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE),"Based on the initial presentation of a 34-year-old man with dysarthria and lower-limb weakness, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

5. Brain tumor affecting the motor pathways

Confidence Level: 60%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09032015/tab-legends, which describes bilateral, nearly symmetrical calcifications of the caudate, lentiform nuclei, and periventricular white matter with sparing of the dentate nuclei, and focal atrophy and subcortical hypodensity within the right parietal lobe suggesting prior infarct, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that would cause these specific imaging findings:

1. Fahr's disease (Primary familial brain calcification)
2. Hypoparathyroidism or pseudohypoparathyroidism
3. Carbon monoxide poisoning or other toxic exposure
4. Mitochondrial disorders (e.g., MELAS)
5. Infectious or post-infectious causes (e.g., congenital infections like TORCH complex)

Confidence Level: 85%

The increased confidence level reflects the additional specificity provided by the imaging findings, which are characteristic of a metabolic or genetic disorder leading to brain calcifications, such as Fahr's disease. The presence of prior infarct could be related to an underlying vasculopathy or thrombotic event secondary to the primary condition. The sparing of the dentate nuclei helps narrow down the differential, as this is not commonly seen in many of the conditions that cause brain calcifications.",85,Insufficient
2015,Brain Death,"Based on the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08272015, a 33-year-old woman is on ventilator support following an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for her condition:

2. Vasospasm leading to ischemic injury
3. Hydrocephalus secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage
4. Cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure
5. Delayed cerebral ischemia

Confidence Level: 80%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08272015/tab-legends, which describes abnormal high T2 signal of the gray matter, effacement of sulci and cisternal spaces, diffuse restricted diffusion with very low ADC values throughout the brain parenchyma, and absence of flow signal in the intracranial circulation on 3D TOF MRA MIP image, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that would cause these specific imaging findings:

1. Global cerebral ischemia/anoxia
2. Diffuse cerebral edema secondary to severe encephalitis
3. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)
4. Malignant cerebral edema post-resuscitation
5. Severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy

Confidence Level: 90%

The increased confidence level reflects the additional specificity provided by the imaging findings, which suggest a severe global process affecting the brain, such as global cerebral ischemia or hypoxic-ischemic injury. The absence of intracranial flow signal is particularly concerning for a catastrophic reduction in cerebral perfusion, which could be due to multiple etiologies, including severe vasospasm post-subarachnoid hemorrhage, global ischemia, or cardiac arrest with subsequent resuscitation. The presence of diffuse restricted diffusion indicates cytotoxic edema, which is commonly seen in acute ischemic processes.",90,Good
2015,Brown Tumor of Hyperparathyroidism,"Based on the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01192015, the patient is a 38-year-old woman with primary hyperparathyroidism presenting with calvarial masses.

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01192015/tab-legends, which describes enhancing intradiploic lesions in the right frontal and left pterional regions with hypo-isointense signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images, and expansile, predominantly lytic lesions on CT, along with histological findings of neoformed bone trabeculae in a fibrous cellular stroma with hemosiderin pigment deposits and ""tunneling"" resorption of trabeculae, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that would cause these specific imaging and histological findings:

1. Brown tumors (osteitis fibrosa cystica) related to hyperparathyroidism
2. Fibrous dysplasia with secondary changes
3. Giant cell tumor of the bone
4. Aneurysmal bone cyst
5. Paget's disease of bone

Confidence Level: 95%

The increased confidence level reflects the additional specificity provided by the imaging and histological findings, which are highly suggestive of Brown tumors associated with primary hyperparathyroidism. The characteristic ""tunneling"" resorption of trabeculae and the presence of hemosiderin deposits are typical of Brown tumors. The clinical context of primary hyperparathyroidism further supports this diagnosis. While other entities such as fibrous dysplasia and giant cell tumor could present with similar imaging features, the patient's history of hyperparathyroidism makes Brown tumors the most likely diagnosis.",95,Excellent
2015,Capillary Telangiectasia,"Based on the summary of the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01082015, a 22-year-old woman presents with a headache. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for her condition:

4. Intracranial mass (e.g., tumor, cyst)
5. Intracranial hemorrhage

Confidence Level: 60%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01082015/tab-legends, which describes an ill-defined hyperintense lesion on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) that demonstrates trace susceptibility and faint enhancement following contrast administration, with no edema or mass effect, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that would cause these specific imaging findings:

1. Low-grade glioma
2. Metastasis
3. Demyelinating lesion (e.g., multiple sclerosis)
4. Infectious process (e.g., abscess, encephalitis)
5. Vascular malformation (e.g., cavernoma)

Confidence Level: 85%

The increased confidence level reflects the additional specificity provided by the imaging findings, which suggest a lesion within the brain parenchyma. The lack of edema or mass effect and the faint enhancement pattern are more suggestive of a low-grade process, such as a low-grade glioma or a demyelinating lesion. Metastasis is less likely in a young patient without known primary cancer, and infectious processes typically present with more pronounced edema and enhancement. A vascular malformation such as a cavernoma could also present with trace susceptibility but would typically have a more characteristic imaging appearance.",85,Insufficient
2015,Carotid-Cochlea Dehiscence,"Based on the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02262015, the patient is a 60-year-old woman with a follow-up study for acoustic schwannoma. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for her condition:

4. Epidermoid cyst
5. Arachnoid cyst

Confidence Level: 80%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02262015/tab-legends, which describes focal dehiscence of the bony plate of the petrous segment of the left internal carotid artery with the basal turn of the cochlea, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that would cause these specific imaging findings:

2. High-riding or aberrant internal carotid artery
3. Temporal bone fracture with involvement of the carotid canal
4. Fibrous dysplasia affecting the temporal bone
5. Congenital anomaly of the petrous carotid canal

Confidence Level: 90%

The increased confidence level reflects the additional specificity provided by the imaging findings, which suggest a bony defect involving the petrous segment of the internal carotid artery adjacent to the cochlea. Carotid-cochlear dehiscence is a condition where there is an absence of bone covering the carotid artery where it is adjacent to the cochlea, which can be congenital or acquired. The other conditions listed are less likely given the specific description of the dehiscence and the location, but they are included in the differential diagnosis to account for other potential causes of bony abnormalities in this region.",90,Excellent

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04272015/tab-legends, which describes an isointense mass lesion in the region of the left cavernous sinus on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), progressive pooling of contrast within the left cavernous sinus lesion on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), and increased uptake in the region of the left cavernous sinus on RBC-tagged scintigraphy, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that would cause these specific imaging findings:

1. Carotid-cavernous fistula
2. Cavernous sinus thrombosis with secondary development of arteriovenous shunting
3. Cavernous sinus aneurysm with thrombosis
4. Dural arteriovenous fistula involving the cavernous sinus
5. Cavernous hemangioma of the cavernous sinus

Confidence Level: 90%

The increased confidence level reflects the additional specificity provided by the imaging findings, which suggest a vascular lesion with abnormal blood flow within the cavernous sinus. The progressive pooling of contrast and increased uptake on scintigraphy are characteristic of a vascular shunt or fistula, such as a carotid-cavernous fistula or a dural arteriovenous fistula. The presence of a mass effect and the specific pattern of contrast enhancement and scintigraphy uptake are less typical for a simple thrombosis or a neoplastic process.",90,Insufficient
2015,Cervical Schwannoma Presenting As Intracranial Posterior Fossa Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH),"Based on the summary of the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12282015, a 75-year-old woman on warfarin with sudden-onset occipital headache, who subsequently developed severe back pain with lower limb hyperreflexia, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Cerebral hemorrhage due to anticoagulation therapy
2. Spinal epidural hematoma
3. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)
4. Vertebral artery dissection
5. Cervical myelopathy due to degenerative spine disease

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12282015/tab-legends, which describes posterior fossa intraventricular and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a blood clot in the cisterna magna, no vascular cause demonstrated on intracranial angiography, abundant hyperintense SAH in the lumbar spine, and an extramedullary intradural enhancing mass at C5/6 with a dumbbell-shaped mass extending through an expanded right foramen and compressing the spinal cord, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that would cause these specific imaging findings:

1. Spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (SDAVF)
2. Spinal epidural hematoma
3. Neoplastic spinal cord compression (e.g., meningioma, nerve sheath tumor)
4. Intracranial SAH with secondary spinal SAH
5. Metastatic disease with spinal involvement

Confidence Level: 85%

The increased confidence level reflects the additional specificity provided by the imaging findings, which suggest a complex presentation involving both intracranial and spinal pathology. The presence of an extramedullary intradural enhancing mass at C5/6 with a dumbbell-shaped extension through the foramen is suggestive of a neoplastic process, such as a nerve sheath tumor or meningioma, which could account for the spinal symptoms. The absence of a vascular cause on angiography makes a SDAVF less likely but does not rule it out. The presence of SAH in both the brain and spine raises the possibility of a connection between the two, such as a ruptured intracranial aneurysm with secondary spinal SAH, although no vascular cause was identified. Metastatic disease could also present with multiple lesions but would typically show more widespread involvement.",85,Excellent
2015,Chordoid Meningioma of the Third Ventricle,"Based on the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12102015, a 16-year-old boy presents with a 1-year history of headache. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for his condition:

1. Migraine
2. Tension-type headache
3. Intracranial mass (e.g., tumor, cyst)
4. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri)
5. Chiari malformation

Confidence Level: 60%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12102015/tab-legends, which describes an intraventricular mass at the region of the right foramen of Munro with associated hydrocephalus and transependymal CSF migration, signal abnormality in the left thalamus, avid enhancement of the lesion on postcontrast T1-weighted imaging, and no diffusion restriction on DWI, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that would cause these specific imaging findings:

1. Central neurocytoma
2. Colloid cyst causing obstructive hydrocephalus
3. Intraventricular meningioma
4. Ependymoma
5. Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (associated with tuberous sclerosis)

Confidence Level: 90%

The increased confidence level reflects the additional specificity provided by the imaging findings, which suggest an intraventricular neoplasm. The location at the foramen of Munro and the pattern of enhancement are characteristic of certain tumors such as central neurocytoma or colloid cyst. The absence of diffusion restriction makes highly cellular tumors like lymphoma less likely. The presence of hydrocephalus is consistent with obstruction at the foramen of Munro, which is a common presentation for colloid cysts and other intraventricular tumors. The signal abnormality in the left thalamus may represent local tumor invasion or secondary effects of hydrocephalus.",90,Insufficient
2015,Chronic Lymphocytic Inflammation With Pontine Perivascular Enhancement Responsive to Steroids (CLIPPERS),"Based on the summary of the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05112015, a 68-year-old man presents with diplopia and dizziness for 20 days, which is alleviated by lying down, and physical examination findings of ataxia and nystagmus. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for his condition:

1. Brainstem stroke
2. Vestibular neuritis
3. Multiple sclerosis
4. Cerebellar tumor
5. Wernicke encephalopathy

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05112015/tab-legends, which describes abnormal signal intensity lesions in the pons, cerebellum, and splenium of the corpus callosum with subtle enhancement on initial study, worsening signal abnormality and enhancement on subsequent study, and mild interval improvement after steroid administration, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that would cause these specific imaging findings:

1. Demyelinating disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis)
2. Central nervous system lymphoma
3. Neurosarcoidosis
4. Metastatic disease
5. Infectious or inflammatory processes (e.g., encephalitis, vasculitis)

Confidence Level: 85%

The increased confidence level reflects the additional specificity provided by the imaging findings, which suggest an inflammatory or demyelinating process, given the response to steroid treatment. The involvement of the pons, cerebellum, and corpus callosum is more typical of demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis, but other inflammatory conditions such as neurosarcoidosis or CNS lymphoma could present similarly. The presence of enhancement and the distribution of lesions would be less typical for a primary cerebellar tumor or Wernicke encephalopathy. Infectious causes should also be considered, especially given the patient's age and the acuity of symptoms.",85,Insufficient
2015,CNS Cryptococcosis,"Based on the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06252015, a 32-year-old man with AIDS presents with severe headaches, nausea, and vomiting, and a blood CD4 count of 5. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for his condition:

1. Central nervous system (CNS) opportunistic infections (e.g., toxoplasmosis, cryptococcosis)
2. Primary CNS lymphoma
3. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)
4. Cerebral infarction due to vasculitis or thrombosis
5. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND)

Confidence Level: 80%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06252015/tab-legends, which describes multiple small foci of restricted diffusion on DWI with no corresponding T2-FLAIR signal abnormalities and no enhancement of the lesions or other abnormal parenchymal or leptomeningeal enhancement on postcontrast sequences, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that would cause these specific imaging findings:

1. Cerebral toxoplasmosis
2. Cryptococcal meningitis
3. Cerebral infarction due to vasculitis or thrombosis
4. Primary CNS lymphoma
5. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)

Confidence Level: 90%

The increased confidence level reflects the additional specificity provided by the imaging findings, which suggest an infectious etiology, particularly given the patient's severely immunocompromised state. The presence of multiple small foci of restricted diffusion could be seen in CNS infections like toxoplasmosis or cryptococcosis, which are common in patients with AIDS. The lack of enhancement makes primary CNS lymphoma less likely, although it cannot be completely ruled out. PML typically shows larger areas of T2-FLAIR hyperintensity without significant mass effect or enhancement, which does not fully correspond to the described imaging findings. Cerebral infarction due to vasculitis or thrombosis is also a consideration in this patient population.",90,Excellent
2015,CNS Tuberculoma,"Based on the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05182015, a 42-year-old man presents with chronic headache and seizures. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for his condition:

1. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)
2. Metastatic brain tumor
3. Abscess
4. Primary CNS lymphoma
5. High-grade glioma (other than GBM)

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05182015/tab-legends, which describes a heterogeneous lesion in the right frontal lobe with surrounding vasogenic edema, mass effect on the ipsilateral lateral ventricle, midline shift to the left, ring-like enhancing pattern on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging, heterogeneous enhancement at the anterior aspect of the lesion, additional foci of discrete enhancement, no diffusion restriction on DWI, and MRS demonstrating a lipid-lactate peak without other peaks, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that would cause these specific imaging findings:

1. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)
2. Metastatic brain tumor
3. Cerebral abscess
4. Anaplastic astrocytoma
5. Demyelinating disease (e.g., tumefactive multiple sclerosis)

Confidence Level: 85%

The increased confidence level reflects the additional specificity provided by the imaging findings, which suggest a high-grade neoplastic process, such as GBM or metastatic brain tumor, given the ring-like enhancement and mass effect. The presence of a lipid-lactate peak on MRS is also suggestive of a high-grade tumor or necrotic process. The lack of diffusion restriction makes a cerebral abscess less likely, although it cannot be completely ruled out. Anaplastic astrocytoma is another possibility, although it typically shows less pronounced ring-like enhancement. Demyelinating disease is less likely given the imaging characteristics but is included due to the presence of vasogenic edema and the absence of other metabolic peaks on MRS.",85,Insufficient
2015,Cobb Syndrome (Spinal Arteriovenous Metameric Syndrome),"Based on the summary of the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03162015, a 10-year-old boy presented with sudden onset of headache followed by low back pain, with an intact neurological examination except for neck stiffness, and a subtle nevus observed on his back. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for his condition:

1. Meningitis
2. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)
3. Spinal cord tumor
4. Chiari malformation with associated syrinx
5. Vertebral and spinal arteriovenous malformation (AVM)

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03162015/tab-legends, which describes a capillary malformation on the patientfs back at the C4-7 dermatomal level, CT showing subarachnoid hemorrhage predominantly in the posterior fossa and upper cervical spine, MRI revealing extensive vascular malformation involving the C4-5 spinal cord and C5-7 vertebral body and paraspinal tissues, and angiogram demonstrating extensive arteriovenous malformations affecting the same regions, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that would cause these specific imaging findings:

1. Spinal arteriovenous malformation (AVM)
2. Spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (SDAVF)
3. Cobb syndrome (cutaneomeningospinal angiomatosis)
4. Subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to vascular malformation
5. Hemorrhagic spinal cord tumor

Confidence Level: 95%

The increased confidence level reflects the additional specificity provided by the imaging findings, which suggest a vascular etiology, particularly an arteriovenous malformation, given the presence of a capillary malformation on the skin, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and extensive involvement of the spinal cord and vertebral bodies. Cobb syndrome, which is characterized by cutaneous and spinal AVMs in the same metamere, is a strong consideration given the dermatomal distribution of the capillary malformation and the corresponding spinal AVM. The presence of SAH indicates a recent hemorrhage likely related to the vascular malformation. Hemorrhagic spinal cord tumors are less likely given the extensive vascular malformation seen on angiography.",95,Excellent
2015,Coccidiodomycosis Spondylitis,"Based on the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06222015, a 33-year-old man from Arizona presents with worsening back pain, shortness of breath, and cough with hemoptysis. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for his condition:

1. Tuberculosis with Pott's disease and pulmonary involvement
2. Metastatic disease with spinal and pulmonary metastases
3. Primary bone tumor with lung metastases
4. Lymphoma with thoracic spine and pulmonary involvement
5. Fungal infection, such as coccidioidomycosis, given the patient's location in Arizona

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06222015/tab-legends, which describes CT contrast-enhanced images showing large paraspinal soft tissue masses with destructive changes of the thoracic spine, scattered nodular opacities within the lung parenchyma, nodular density along the right pleura, and mediastinal adenopathy, as well as MRI images demonstrating infiltration of the spinal column from T4_T9 contiguous with the paraspinal soft tissue masses, sparing of the disc spaces, and extension into the anterior epidural space causing spinal canal narrowing and cord compression, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that would cause these specific imaging findings:

1. Tuberculosis with Pott's disease and pulmonary involvement
2. Metastatic disease with spinal and pulmonary metastases
3. Lymphoma with thoracic spine and pulmonary involvement
4. Fungal infection, such as coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis, with disseminated disease
5. Sarcoidosis with spinal and pulmonary involvement

Confidence Level: 85%

The increased confidence level reflects the additional specificity provided by the imaging findings, which suggest a systemic disease process with both pulmonary and spinal involvement. The presence of destructive changes in the spine, paraspinal masses, and lung nodules is characteristic of an infectious or neoplastic process. Given the patient's location in Arizona, a fungal infection such as coccidioidomycosis should be strongly considered. Tuberculosis is also a key differential diagnosis due to the classic presentation of Pott's disease with pulmonary tuberculosis. Metastatic disease and lymphoma are included due to the presence of mediastinal adenopathy and the destructive nature of the spinal lesions. Sarcoidosis is less likely but can present with multisystem involvement and should be considered.",85,Excellent
2015,"(Corneal) Staphyloma, Anterior","Based on the summary of the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08132015, a 5-year-old girl presents with a blackish mass protruding from the left eye since birth. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for her condition:

1. Congenital melanocytosis (ocular melanocytosis)
2. Dermoid cyst
3. Congenital ocular melanoma
4. Capillary hemangioma
5. Retinoblastoma

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08132015/tab-legends, which describes an out-pouching on the anterior aspect of the left globe with enlargement of the anterior chamber, normal lens and posterior chamber, and no evidence of intraocular calcifications, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that would cause these specific imaging findings:

1. Congenital cystic eye
2. Coloboma of the iris or choroid
3. Anterior segment dysgenesis (e.g., Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome)
4. Congenital glaucoma
5. Staphyloma

Confidence Level: 85%

The increased confidence level reflects the additional specificity provided by the imaging findings, which suggest a congenital anomaly affecting the anterior segment of the eye. The presence of an out-pouching on the anterior aspect of the globe and enlargement of the anterior chamber are more consistent with structural anomalies such as a congenital cystic eye, coloboma, or anterior segment dysgenesis. Congenital glaucoma could also present with enlargement of the anterior chamber but would typically have additional signs such as corneal edema or optic nerve cupping. Staphyloma refers to an abnormal protrusion of the uveal tissue and could be considered given the description of a blackish mass. The absence of intraocular calcifications makes retinoblastoma less likely.",85,Excellent
2015,Cystic Schwannoma of the Cauda Equina,"Based on the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02052015, a 47-year-old woman presents with progressive right-sided lumbosciatica. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for her condition:

1. Lumbar disc herniation
2. Spinal stenosis
3. Spondylolisthesis
4. Lumbar radiculopathy due to nerve root compression
5. Spinal tumor (e.g., schwannoma, meningioma)

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02052015/tab-legends, which describes a well-defined, intradural, extramedullary, complex cystic lesion of the cauda equina with displacement of nerve roots and no foraminal extension, no canal expansion, and no scalloping of the posterior wall of the vertebral body, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that would cause these specific imaging findings:

1. Schwannoma or neurofibroma
2. Meningioma
3. Arachnoid cyst
4. Ependymoma (myxopapillary subtype)
5. Tarlov (perineural) cyst

Confidence Level: 90%

The increased confidence level reflects the additional specificity provided by the imaging findings, which suggest an intradural extramedullary lesion, likely of a benign nature given the well-defined margins and lack of aggressive features such as bone erosion. Schwannomas and neurofibromas are common intradural extramedullary tumors that can present with lumbosciatica due to nerve root compression. Meningiomas are also a consideration, although they are less common in the cauda equina region. Arachnoid cysts can cause similar displacement of nerve roots but typically have a simpler cystic appearance. Ependymomas, particularly the myxopapillary subtype, are found in the filum terminale and can present with similar imaging characteristics. Tarlov cysts are perineural cysts that occur along the nerve roots but are usually asymptomatic; however, they can sometimes cause symptoms if they are large enough.",90,Excellent
2015,Dialysis-Related Spondyloarthropathy,"Based on the summary of the content provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05142015, a 48-year-old man on dialysis with chronic back pain presents with imaging findings suggestive of spinal pathology. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for his condition:

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05142015/tab-legends, which describes sclerosis of the inferior end plate of L5 and superior end plate of S1, grade I anterior listhesis of L5 on S1, and heterogeneous enhancement of the L5_S1 disc space extending into the adjacent vertebral bodies, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that would cause these specific imaging findings:

1. Infectious spondylodiscitis (e.g., bacterial, tuberculous)
2. Dialysis-related spondyloarthropathy
3. Degenerative disc disease with secondary infection
4. Neoplastic disease affecting the spine (e.g., metastasis, primary bone tumor)
5. Charcot spine (neuropathic arthropathy)

Confidence Level: 85%

The increased confidence level reflects the additional specificity provided by the imaging findings, which suggest an infectious or inflammatory process, given the enhancement pattern and sclerosis of the vertebral end plates. Infectious spondylodiscitis is a strong consideration, especially in a patient on dialysis who may be immunocompromised. Dialysis-related spondyloarthropathy is also a possibility due to the patient's history of dialysis. Degenerative disc disease could be complicated by secondary infection. Neoplastic disease is less likely but should be considered given the heterogeneous enhancement. Charcot spine is included due to the presence of listhesis and sclerosis, although it is less common in the absence of a known neuropathic condition.",85,Excellent
2015,Diffuse Axonal Injury,"Based on the initial presentation of a healthy 22-year-old individual in a coma after a road traffic accident, as provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08242015, here are five initial differential diagnoses for the coma:

3. Cerebral contusion
4. Post-traumatic cerebral edema
5. Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury secondary to trauma

Confidence Level: 80%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08242015/tab-legends, which describes multiple subcortical white matter and corona radiata T2-hyperintense lesions, diffuse hyperintensity and mild swelling of the splenium, diffuse periventricular white matter and callosal diffusion restriction on DWI, no hemorrhagic component on T2 GRE, and splenial signal abnormality with relative sparing of the remainder of the corpus callosum on Sagittal T2WI, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that would cause these specific imaging findings:

1. Diffuse axonal injury (DAI)
2. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)
3. Central pontine myelinolysis (osmotic demyelination syndrome)
4. Marchiafava-Bignami disease
5. Metabolic encephalopathy (e.g., hepatic encephalopathy, uremic encephalopathy)

Confidence Level: 90%

The increased confidence level reflects the additional specificity provided by the imaging findings, which suggest a pattern of white matter injury that could be consistent with DAI, especially in the context of a road traffic accident. The involvement of the corpus callosum, particularly the splenium, and the absence of a hemorrhagic component also raise the possibility of conditions like ADEM, central pontine myelinolysis, or Marchiafava-Bignami disease, although these are less common in the setting of trauma. Metabolic encephalopathy is included due to the diffuse nature of the imaging findings, but there is no provided history of liver or kidney disease.",90,Excellent
2015,Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma,"Based on the initial presentation of a 4-year-old girl with new-onset right hand tremor, ataxic gait, and headache, here are five initial differential diagnoses for her condition:

3. Cerebellar astrocytoma
4. Demyelinating disease (e.g., acute disseminated encephalomyelitis)
5. Infectious or post-infectious cerebellitis

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02122015/tab-legends, which describes a minimally enhancing expansile mass of the pons causing compression of the fourth ventricle, an ill-defined, infiltrative, and predominantly hyperintense mass lesion on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and an expansile pontine lesion with a central enhancing component on sagittal contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that would cause these specific imaging findings:

1. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG)
2. Focal brainstem glioma
3. Brainstem encephalitis
4. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH)
5. Metastatic disease (less common in this age group)

Confidence Level: 90%

The increased confidence level reflects the additional specificity provided by the imaging findings, which suggest a brainstem neoplasm, particularly a glioma, given the location, infiltrative nature, and imaging characteristics of the lesion. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma is a leading consideration due to the typical presentation and imaging features. Focal brainstem glioma is also possible but usually presents with a more circumscribed lesion. Brainstem encephalitis could present with similar T2 hyperintensity but would typically have a different clinical course. LCH can involve the brainstem but often has more distinct imaging features and systemic manifestations. Metastatic disease is rare in this age group but included for completeness.",90,Excellent
2015,Dilated Perivascular Space of the Anterior Superior Temporal Lobe,"Based on the initial presentation of a 40-year-old woman with TIA symptoms and an incidental finding of a temporal lobe lesion that has been stable on serial MRI follow-up for 33 months, as provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11122015, here are five initial differential diagnoses for her condition:

1. Low-grade glioma
2. Ganglioglioma
3. Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET)
4. Arachnoid cyst
5. Focal cortical dysplasia

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11122015/tab-legends, which describes a nonenhancing subcortical cystic lesion at the base of the anterior superior temporal gyrus with a prominent amount of surrounding perilesional T2/FLAIR hyperintensity and no associated mass effect or restricted diffusion, the differential diagnoses should be revised to focus on conditions that would cause these specific imaging findings:

1. Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET)
2. Low-grade glioma
3. Ganglioglioma
4. Cerebral cyst (e.g., neuroglial cyst, arachnoid cyst)
5. Focal cortical dysplasia with associated cystic component

Confidence Level: 85%

The increased confidence level reflects the additional specificity provided by the imaging findings, which suggest a benign, nonenhancing, and stable lesion with surrounding gliosis but without significant mass effect. The stability of the lesion over 33 months and the lack of enhancement or restricted diffusion are more characteristic of a benign entity such as DNET or a low-grade glioma. Ganglioglioma is also a consideration due to its similar imaging appearance and occurrence in the temporal lobe. Cerebral cysts can present as nonenhancing lesions but typically do not have extensive surrounding FLAIR hyperintensity. Focal cortical dysplasia may have an associated cystic component, but it is less likely to present as a well-defined cystic lesion.",85,Insufficient

1. Carotid artery stenosis
2. Carotid artery dissection
3. Fibromuscular dysplasia
4. Carotid body tumor (paraganglioma)
5. Arteriovenous malformation

Confidence Level: 60%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09212015/tab-legends), which describes an echo-doppler image showing an unusually large caliber vessel in the proximal right vertebral artery, duplex visualization revealing hyperemic and low resistance flow, T2WI showing a dilated posterior epidural venous plexus at C7-T1 level, and angiography revealing a simple direct single-hole fistula between a segmental branch of the vertebral artery and the epidural venous plexus at C7-T1 level with a large network of dilated epidural and paraspinal veins, the differential diagnoses can be revised to:

1. Vertebral arteriovenous fistula (AVF)
2. Vertebral artery aneurysm
3. Vertebral artery dissection with associated pseudoaneurysm
4. Dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF)
5. Spinal arteriovenous malformation (AVM)

Given the specific imaging findings described, the most likely diagnosis is a vertebral arteriovenous fistula (AVF), particularly because of the direct single-hole fistula noted between the vertebral artery and the epidural venous plexus.

2. Chronic infectious osteomyelitis
3. Metastatic disease
4. Drug-induced hyperostosis (e.g., from retinoids or fluorides)
5. Paraneoplastic hypertrophic osteoarthropathy

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional information from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10052015/tab-legends), which describes progressive flowing periosteal sternomanubrial and paravertebral calcifications, as well as nodular and thick lamellar periosteal calcific changes within the thoracic spine, ribs, inferior scapulae, clavicles, and proximal humeral shafts after 4 years of voriconazole therapy, the differential diagnoses can be revised to:

1. Voriconazole-induced periostitis (given the strong temporal association with voriconazole therapy and characteristic imaging findings)
2. Fluorosis (though less likely given the specific medication history)
3. Hypervitaminosis A (retinoid toxicity)
4. Secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (unlikely given the absence of underlying lung malignancy)
5. Endocrine disorders such as hyperparathyroidism (which can cause subperiosteal resorption rather than periosteal reaction)

Given the specific history of voriconazole therapy and the characteristic imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is voriconazole-induced periostitis.

2. Hypopituitarism
3. Panhypopituitarism
4. Congenital hypopituitarism (e.g., septo-optic dysplasia)
5. Pituitary dwarfism

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings provided in the content from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01052015/tab-legends), which describes a hypoplastic and partially empty sella with the absence of the normal bright posterior pituitary spot and instead a bright spot seen in the suprasellar region near the optic chiasm, the differential diagnoses can be revised to:

1. Ectopic posterior pituitary
2. Septo-optic dysplasia (de Morsier syndrome)
3. Pituitary stalk interruption syndrome
4. Congenital growth hormone deficiency
5. Rathke's cleft cyst (less likely given the bright spot indicating functioning pituitary tissue)

Given the specific imaging findings of an ectopic bright spot in the suprasellar region and the clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is an ectopic posterior pituitary, which is often associated with pituitary hormone deficiencies, including growth hormone.

5. Mitochondrial disorders (such as MELAS)

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging findings provided in the content from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07162015/tab-legends), which describes bilateral symmetric hyperintensity signal of the striatum (caudate nuclei and putamina), with swelling of the deep and cortical grey matter, striatal facilitated diffusion, and no contrast enhancement, the differential diagnoses can be revised to:

1. Acute necrotizing encephalopathy
2. Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS)
3. Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration)

The presence of a ring-enhancing lesion with significant perilesional edema and mass effect is more suggestive of an infectious or inflammatory process, such as a brain abscess, or a high-grade neoplastic process. The complete resolution after surgery and steroid therapy increases the likelihood of an inflammatory or infectious etiology. However, without specific histopathological results, the confidence levels cannot be set to the highest, as there is still a differential to consider.",60,Insufficient
2015,Intracranial Cystic Cavernous Malformations,"Based on the clinical information provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05282015, a 53-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with new-onset seizure. Here are five initial differential diagnoses based on this clinical presentation:

1. Cerebral vascular accident (stroke) - Confidence level: 40%
2. Primary brain tumor (e.g., glioma) - Confidence level: 50%
3. Metastatic brain lesion - Confidence level: 45%
4. Infectious process (e.g., brain abscess) - Confidence level: 35%
5. Inflammatory/demyelinating disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis) - Confidence level: 30%

After reviewing the imaging findings described in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05282015/tab-legends, which include a right frontal cystic lesion with a hyperdense solid nodule, a hypointense central solid component on T2WI, signal cancellation on T2 FLAIR, signal dephasing of the solid component on T2* without coarse calcifications, and minimal enhancement of the solid component on CE-T1WI, the differential diagnoses can be revised. The presence of a rim of hemosiderin deposition in the cyst wall suggests previous hemorrhage.

Revised differential diagnoses considering the imaging characteristics:

1. Cystic neoplasm with hemorrhagic component (e.g., cystic glioblastoma) - Confidence level: 70%
2. Parasitic infection (e.g., neurocysticercosis) - Confidence level: 65%
3. Hemorrhagic metastasis - Confidence level: 60%
4. Pyogenic brain abscess with hemorrhage - Confidence level: 55%
5. Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) with associated hemorrhage - Confidence level: 50%

The imaging characteristics suggest a lesion with complex features, including hemorrhage, which is not typical for common cystic lesions like simple arachnoid cysts. The presence of hemosiderin and the hyperdense nodule on non-contrast CT (NECT) raise the possibility of a neoplasm with hemorrhagic or calcific elements, an infectious process like neurocysticercosis, or a vascular malformation. The confidence levels reflect the complexity of the lesion and the need for further clinical correlation and possibly histopathological confirmation.",70,Insufficient
2015,Intraspinal Epidermoid Cyst,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 30-year-old man with a history of low back pain and bilateral paresthesia in the lower limbs, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06292015, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Lumbar disc herniation with nerve root compression - Confidence level: 60%
2. Spinal canal stenosis - Confidence level: 55%
3. Lumbar spondylosis - Confidence level: 50%
4. Spinal cord tumor (e.g., ependymoma, astrocytoma) - Confidence level: 45%
5. Inflammatory or demyelinating disease (e.g., transverse myelitis, multiple sclerosis) - Confidence level: 40%

After reviewing the imaging findings described in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06292015/tab-legends, which include a well-defined T2-hyperintense, T1-hypointense nonenhancing intra- and extramedullary lesion located at the conus/cauda equina, with restricted diffusion demonstrated on DWI and ADC maps, the differential diagnoses can be revised. The characteristics of the lesion suggest a focus on neoplastic and cystic pathologies.

Revised differential diagnoses considering the imaging characteristics:

1. Myxopapillary ependymoma - Confidence level: 75%
2. Schwannoma - Confidence level: 70%
3. Neurofibroma - Confidence level: 70%
4. Arachnoid cyst - Confidence level: 65%
5. Hemangioblastoma - Confidence level: 60%

The presence of a well-defined lesion with restricted diffusion and its location at the conus/cauda equina region raises the likelihood of a tumor such as myxopapillary ependymoma, which is known to occur in this region. Schwannomas and neurofibromas are also common in the cauda equina. The nonenhancing nature of the lesion makes an arachnoid cyst a possibility, although these typically do not show restricted diffusion. Hemangioblastomas are less common but can present with similar imaging features. The confidence levels reflect the imaging characteristics and the commonality of these lesions in the described location.",75,Insufficient
2015,Intravascular Large B-Cell Lymphoma (IVL),"Based on the clinical presentation of a 58-year-old woman with changes in her mental status, seizures, and fever of unknown origin, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06152015, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

2. Autoimmune encephalitis (e.g., limbic encephalitis) - Confidence level: 65%
3. Cerebral vasculitis - Confidence level: 60%
4. Metastatic disease - Confidence level: 55%
5. Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) - Confidence level: 50%

After reviewing the imaging findings and pathology results described in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06152015/tab-legends, which include a right fronto-temporal corticosubcortical non-enhancing low-density lesion with a focal punctuate hemorrhage, high T2 signal, small cortical foci of signal dephasing, no diffusion restriction, and no parenchymal or leptomeningeal enhancement, along with a pathologic specimen showing peri and intravascular lymphocytic infiltrate with a high proliferative index and immunohistochemistry consistent with a large B-cell lymphoma, the differential diagnoses can be revised.

Revised differential diagnoses considering the imaging characteristics and pathology:

1. Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) - Confidence level: 95%
2. High-grade glioma with hemorrhagic component - Confidence level: 70%
3. Metastatic brain lesion with hemorrhage - Confidence level: 65%
4. Infectious process (e.g., brain abscess with hemorrhage) - Confidence level: 60%
5. Cerebral vasculitis with secondary hemorrhage - Confidence level: 55%

The imaging findings, when correlated with the pathology results, strongly suggest the diagnosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). The lack of enhancement is atypical for PCNSL, but the pathology results are definitive. The high confidence level for PCNSL is based on the specific immunohistochemical staining pattern and the presence of a high proliferative index, which are characteristic of this type of lymphoma. The other conditions listed are less likely given the pathology results but were included as they can present with similar imaging features.",95,Good
2015,Intraventricular Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 65-year-old immunocompetent patient with a headache of 3 months duration, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09282015, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Meningioma - Confidence level: 60%

3. Colloid cyst - Confidence level: 65%
4. Intraventricular meningioma - Confidence level: 60%
5. Intraventricular metastasis - Confidence level: 55%

The imaging characteristics, particularly the location of the lesions within the ventricles, the pattern of enhancement, and the MR spectroscopy findings, suggest a neoplastic process. Central neurocytoma and subependymoma are more commonly found in the ventricles and can present with similar imaging features. Colloid cysts are also a consideration for intraventricular lesions, though they typically occur in the third ventricle. Intraventricular meningiomas are less common but can present with intense enhancement. Intraventricular metastasis is less likely but should be considered in the differential diagnosis. The confidence levels reflect the imaging characteristics and the commonality of these lesions in the described location.",75,Insufficient
2015,Intraventricular Schwannoma,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 33-year-old woman with a headache, right upper quadrant visual cut, and difficulty reading, and the imaging findings from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11302015, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

2. Glioma - Confidence level: 65%
3. Metastatic brain lesion - Confidence level: 60%
4. Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) - Confidence level: 55%
5. Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) - Confidence level: 50%

After reviewing the diagram description provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11302015/tab-legends, which describes an enhancing lesion along the left periatrial/posterior temporal lobe region with reticulin staining more consistent with schwannoma than either meningioma or ependymoma, and vimentin staining somewhat less likely to be positive in an ependymoma, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

Revised differential diagnoses considering the imaging characteristics and histopathology:

1. Schwannoma - Confidence level: 90%
2. Meningioma - Confidence level: 70% (less likely given reticulin staining)
3. Ependymoma - Confidence level: 60% (less likely given vimentin staining)
4. Metastatic brain lesion - Confidence level: 65% (still a consideration without known primary)
5. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) - Confidence level: 55% (less likely but possible given enhancement)

The imaging findings of an enhancing lesion in the periatrial/posterior temporal lobe region, along with the histopathological findings of strong reticulin staining, suggest a diagnosis of schwannoma. The high confidence level for schwannoma is based on the specific staining pattern, which is characteristic of this type of tumor. Meningioma and ependymoma are less likely given the staining results but are included due to their potential to present with similar imaging features. Metastatic disease and GBM are less likely but included as differential considerations due to the presence of an enhancing brain lesion.",90,Excellent
2015,Ipilimumab-Induced Hypophysitis,"Based on the clinical history of a 52-year-old man with a history of melanoma, presenting with headaches, visual symptoms, and panhypopituitarism, as provided in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09072015, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

2. Pituitary adenoma - Confidence level: 60%
3. Lymphocytic hypophysitis - Confidence level: 50%
4. Granulomatous disease (e.g., sarcoidosis, tuberculosis) involving the pituitary - Confidence level: 40%
5. Pituitary apoplexy - Confidence level: 35%

After reviewing the imaging findings described in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09072015/tab-legends, which include coronal and axial postcontrast T1-weighted images showing a diffusely enlarged, homogeneously enhancing pituitary gland with mild enlargement of the infundibulum, and a sagittal postcontrast T1-weighted image from 4 months prior, the differential diagnoses can be revised.

Revised differential diagnoses considering the imaging characteristics:

1. Metastatic melanoma to the pituitary gland - Confidence level: 85%
2. Pituitary macroadenoma with homogeneous enhancement - Confidence level: 65%
3. Lymphocytic hypophysitis with diffuse gland involvement - Confidence level: 55%
4. Granulomatous disease involving the pituitary - Confidence level: 45%
5. Germinoma or other germ cell tumor involving the pituitary - Confidence level: 40%

The history of melanoma and the imaging findings of a diffusely enlarged, homogeneously enhancing pituitary gland with infundibular enlargement increase the likelihood of metastatic disease to the pituitary, which is known to occur in patients with melanoma. Pituitary adenomas are common, but they typically do not present with panhypopituitarism unless they are large and compressive. Lymphocytic hypophysitis and granulomatous diseases are less common but can cause diffuse enlargement and should be considered. Germ cell tumors are rare but can present with similar imaging findings and may be associated with diabetes insipidus, which can be a part of panhypopituitarism. The confidence levels reflect the imaging characteristics, the clinical history, and the commonality of these conditions.",85,Insufficient
2015,Isolated Nasopharyngeal Amyloidoma,"Based on the clinical information provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07132015, which describes a 65-year-old man with an incidental right paramedian nasopharyngeal mucosal mass, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma - Confidence level: 70%
2. Benign nasopharyngeal polyp - Confidence level: 65%
3. Squamous papilloma - Confidence level: 60%
4. Lymphoma - Confidence level: 55%
5. Minor salivary gland tumor - Confidence level: 50%

After reviewing the imaging findings described in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07132015/tab-legends, which include a small nasopharyngeal polypoid mucosal nodule that is isointense to the muscles on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), with low signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and moderate, mostly peripheral, enhancement, and the biopsy showing chronically inflamed squamous mucosa with underlying amyloid deposition compatible with isolated amyloidoma, the differential diagnoses can be revised.

Revised differential diagnoses considering the imaging characteristics and biopsy results:

1. Isolated amyloidoma - Confidence level: 90%
2. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma - Confidence level: 50% (less likely given biopsy results)
3. Benign nasopharyngeal polyp - Confidence level: 70% (considering the polypoid nature but less likely due to amyloid deposition)
4. Inverted papilloma - Confidence level: 60% (given the enhancement pattern but less likely due to amyloid deposition)
5. Lymphoma - Confidence level: 40% (less likely given biopsy results)

The imaging characteristics and biopsy results strongly suggest the diagnosis of isolated amyloidoma, which is a rare condition characterized by the deposition of amyloid in the nasopharyngeal mucosa. The high confidence level for isolated amyloidoma is based on the specific biopsy findings. The other conditions listed are less likely given the biopsy results but were included as they can present with similar imaging features.",90,Excellent
2015,Jugular Schwannoma,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 34-year-old woman with headache, impaired hearing in the right ear, and imbalance for 3 months, and the imaging findings from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10122015, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

3. Paraganglioma (glomus jugulare tumor) - Confidence level: 60%
4. Metastatic lesion - Confidence level: 50%
5. Cholesteatoma - Confidence level: 45%

After reviewing the additional imaging and histopathological findings described in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10122015/tab-legends, which include a well-defined lesion in the right cerebellopontine angle extending from the right jugular foramen without extracranial extension, causing deformity of the brainstem, fourth ventricle, and cerebellum, and the presence of intratumoral microhemorrhages and spindle cells of neural origin, the differential diagnoses can be revised.

Revised differential diagnoses considering the imaging characteristics and histopathology:

1. Schwannoma (other than vestibular schwannoma, given the normal internal auditory canal) - Confidence level: 85%
2. Paraganglioma (glomus jugulare tumor) - Confidence level: 80%
3. Meningioma - Confidence level: 70%
4. Metastatic lesion - Confidence level: 55%
5. Epidermoid cyst - Confidence level: 50% (less likely given the strong enhancement and microhemorrhages)

The imaging characteristics, particularly the location and the absence of extracranial extension, along with the histopathological findings of spindle cells of neural origin, suggest a diagnosis of schwannoma. The normal internal auditory canal makes a vestibular schwannoma less likely. Paragangliomas are also a strong consideration due to the widening of the jugular foramen. Meningiomas can occur in this location but may have a different enhancement pattern. Metastatic lesions and epidermoid cysts are less likely but included due to their potential to appear in the cerebellopontine angle. The confidence levels reflect the imaging characteristics, the location of the lesion, and the histopathological findings.",85,Excellent
2015,Kallmann Syndrome,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 28-year-old man with congenital anosmia, delayed puberty, and infertility, and the imaging findings from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07202015, which include absent olfactory bulbs in the olfactory subarachnoid cistern, absence of olfactory sulci, and a small anterior pituitary gland with a normal pituitary stalk, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

2. Isolated congenital anosmia - Confidence level: 70%
3. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (non-Kallmann) - Confidence level: 65%
4. Septo-optic dysplasia - Confidence level: 60%
5. Craniopharyngioma (considering the small anterior pituitary gland) - Confidence level: 50%

After reviewing the diagram description provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07202015/tab-legends, which confirms the absence of olfactory bulbs and sulci and shows a small anterior pituitary gland, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

Revised differential diagnoses considering the imaging characteristics:

1. Kallmann syndrome - Confidence level: 95%
2. Isolated congenital anosmia with associated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism - Confidence level: 80%
3. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (non-Kallmann) with an unrelated pituitary anomaly - Confidence level: 75%
4. Septo-optic dysplasia (less likely given the normal pituitary stalk and absence of optic nerve abnormalities) - Confidence level: 55%
5. Craniopharyngioma (less likely given the absence of a mass lesion) - Confidence level: 45%

The clinical features of anosmia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, along with the imaging findings, are highly suggestive of Kallmann syndrome, a genetic condition characterized by the combination of these symptoms and the absence of olfactory bulbs. The high confidence level for Kallmann syndrome is based on the strong correlation between the clinical and imaging findings. Other conditions are less likely but included due to their potential to present with similar clinical features or imaging findings.",95,Excellent

4. Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease - Confidence level: 65%
5. Necrotizing lymphadenitis (e.g., due to bacterial infection) - Confidence level: 60%

The imaging findings of cervical adenopathy with central necrosis and peripheral enhancement are characteristic of tuberculous lymphadenitis, which is more prevalent in individuals from South East Asia. Lymphoma is also a strong consideration given the extent of lymphadenopathy. Metastatic carcinoma is a possibility, especially in the presence of known primary tumors. Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is a self-limiting condition that can present with cervical lymphadenopathy and fever, particularly in young women. Necrotizing lymphadenitis could be due to other infectious etiologies. The confidence levels reflect the imaging characteristics and the epidemiological context of the patient.",85,Good

5. Otosclerosis - Confidence level: 55%

After reviewing the diagram description provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10222015/tab-legends, which describes axial CT imaging showing opacification of the left mastoid air cells and sclerotic bone changes with no evidence of ossification of the left cochlea, and axial T2-weighted MRI demonstrating low signal intensity within the left cochlea and internal auditory canal suggestive of fibrosis, as well as high signal intensity fluid within the ipsilateral mastoid air cells, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

Revised differential diagnoses considering the imaging characteristics:

1. Vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma) with secondary mastoiditis - Confidence level: 85%
2. Labyrinthitis ossificans - Confidence level: 80%
3. Chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma and secondary labyrinthitis - Confidence level: 75%
4. Otosclerosis, particularly cochlear otosclerosis - Confidence level: 70%
5. Intralabyrinthine schwannoma - Confidence level: 65%

The imaging findings of sclerotic bone changes and low signal intensity within the cochlea and internal auditory canal suggest a process such as labyrinthitis ossificans or an intralabyrinthine schwannoma. The presence of high signal intensity fluid in the mastoid air cells may indicate a secondary inflammatory process such as mastoiditis. Vestibular schwannoma remains a consideration, especially with the involvement of the internal auditory canal, but the lack of cochlear ossification and the presence of fibrosis are less typical. Chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma could explain the mastoid air cell changes but would not typically cause fibrosis within the cochlea. Otosclerosis is included due to the sclerotic bone changes, although it usually does not cause significant mastoiditis. The confidence levels reflect the imaging characteristics and the clinical presentation.",85,Excellent

4. Congenital cholesteatoma with secondary infection and complications - Confidence level: 65%
5. Tuberculous otitis media with secondary pulmonary involvement - Confidence level: 60%

The combination of a destructive temporal bone lesion and diffuse pulmonary findings raises the suspicion for a systemic process such as Langerhans cell histiocytosis, which can affect multiple organ systems and is known to cause lytic bone lesions and pulmonary changes. Acute otitis media with mastoiditis is common in children but less likely to cause such extensive pulmonary findings unless there are associated complications. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant tumor that can present with aggressive local destruction. Congenital cholesteatoma may present with local bone destruction but is less likely to cause diffuse pulmonary findings. Tuberculous otitis media is rare but could potentially explain both the ear and pulmonary findings if there is disseminated disease.

5. An infectious process such as tuberculosis (Pott disease) - Confidence level: 60%

The imaging findings of an aggressive osteolytic lesion with soft tissue extension and enhancement are suggestive of a malignant process such as Ewing sarcoma, which is more common in pediatric patients. Osteomyelitis remains a strong consideration, especially if there is a history of infection or fever. LCH can present with osteolytic lesions and soft tissue involvement but is less common. Metastatic disease, such as from a primary neuroblastoma, is also a possibility in this age group. Tuberculosis can cause vertebral destruction and paravertebral abscess formation, known as Pott disease, and should be considered, especially in endemic areas or in the presence of systemic symptoms.

5. Spinal cord tumor or syrinx causing myelopathy - Confidence level: 40% (less likely given the extensive white matter changes)

The imaging findings of diffuse white matter changes with specific tract involvement and sparing of the U-fibers are highly suggestive of a leukodystrophy. Hereditary spastic paraplegia is also a consideration given the spasticity and tract-specific findings. Mitochondrial disorders can present with similar neurologic deficits and white matter changes. Alexander disease is a rare form of leukodystrophy that could present with these findings but is less common. A spinal cord tumor or syrinx is less likely given the lack of a focal lesion and the extensive white matter involvement.

3. Lymphangioma or other vascular malformation - Confidence level: 60%
4. Minor salivary gland tumor - Confidence level: 55%
5. Thyroglossal duct cyst - Confidence level: 50%

After reviewing the diagram description provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03232015/tab-legends, which describes postcontrast reconstructed sagittal (A) and axial (B) CT scans demonstrating a hyperdense mass lesion at the tongue base in the midline, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

Revised differential diagnoses considering the imaging characteristics:

1. Benign lingual thyroid nodule - Confidence level: 80%
2. Squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue base - Confidence level: 70%
3. Thyroglossal duct cyst (less likely if no enhancement) - Confidence level: 60%
4. Minor salivary gland tumor (e.g., adenoid cystic carcinoma) - Confidence level: 65%
5. Lymphangioma or other vascular malformation (less likely given hyperdensity) - Confidence level: 55%

The presence of a hyperdense mass lesion at the tongue base in the midline is most suggestive of a lingual thyroid nodule, especially if the patient has no history of thyroid disease and the lesion demonstrates enhancement. Squamous cell carcinoma is a consideration given the location, but it typically presents in older patients with risk factors such as smoking or alcohol use. Thyroglossal duct cysts can occur in the midline but are typically not hyperdense. Minor salivary gland tumors are possible but less common in this location. Vascular malformations like lymphangiomas are usually not hyperdense on CT.

4. Metastatic disease, less likely in the absence of known primary but possible given the multiple lesions - Confidence level: 65%
5. Granulomatous disease such as tuberculosis, especially if there is a risk factor or endemic exposure - Confidence level: 60%

The imaging findings of multiple nodular and ring-enhancing lesions with associated meningeal enhancement and restricted diffusion suggest an infectious or granulomatous process. CNS infections, particularly fungal or parasitic, can present with such a pattern. Neurosarcoidosis and CNS lymphoma are also considerations given the imaging findings. Metastatic disease is less likely without a known primary cancer but should be considered. Tuberculosis could present similarly, especially in endemic areas or in patients with risk factors.

The imaging findings of diffuse calvarial thickening and hyperostosis of the skull, along with the bilateral temporal lobe abnormalities, suggest a systemic process affecting both the bone and the brain. Van Buchem disease and sclerosteosis are both genetic disorders characterized by bone overgrowth, which could explain the calvarial thickening. Metabolic or mitochondrial disorders like MELAS can cause white matter changes and should be considered. Limbic encephalitis typically presents with temporal lobe involvement but may not explain the skull changes. Dysplasia or leukodystrophy could present with white matter changes but are less likely to cause the described bone abnormalities.

5. Chronic ischemic small vessel disease, although the presence of cysts and low ferritin levels are less typical - Confidence level: 60%

The imaging findings of hypointense basal ganglia with cysts and susceptibility effects, along with low ferritin levels, suggest a disorder of metal metabolism such as neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA). Wilson's disease is also a consideration due to the involvement of the basal ganglia and potential systemic manifestations, although the ferritin level is not typically low in Wilson's disease. MSA is included due to the gait disturbance and atrophy, but it does not typically present with low ferritin or the described imaging findings. Secondary parkinsonism and chronic ischemic changes are less likely but included for completeness.

5. Post-traumatic skull deformity (less likely given the pattern of suture fusion) - Confidence level: 60%

The imaging findings of multisuture craniosynostosis with specific suture involvement and the absence of intra-occipital synchondrosis fusion suggest a diagnosis of complex craniosynostosis. The possibility of a syndromic form of craniosynostosis is raised due to the involvement of multiple sutures. Non-syndromic craniosynostosis is also a consideration, although it typically involves fewer sutures. Secondary craniosynostosis due to metabolic or hematologic disorders is less common but should be considered. Post-traumatic deformity is less likely given the specific pattern of suture fusion and the age of the patient.

2015,Norrie Disease,"Based on the content provided from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12142015), the case involves a 5-month-old boy with bilateral leukokoria and bilateral retrolental masses. His elder brother has a history of congenital blindness and developed hearing loss at the age of 12. The patient's two elder sisters are normal. Considering this clinical information, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Retinoblastoma _ A malignant tumor of the retina, often hereditary, and can present with leukokoria.
2. Persistent fetal vasculature (PFV) / Persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV) _ A congenital anomaly where the fetal vasculature fails to regress, leading to leukokoria.
3. Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) _ A genetic disorder affecting the growth and development of the retinal vasculature.
4. Coats disease _ A rare condition characterized by abnormal development of the blood vessels behind the retina, leading to leukokoria.
5. Norrie disease _ A rare X-linked genetic disorder that can cause blindness and may be associated with hearing loss.

The ""Martini glass"" appearance is characteristic of Norrie disease. Therefore, the revised differential diagnosis with a high level of confidence would be:

1. Norrie disease _ Given the imaging findings and the clinical history of congenital blindness and hearing loss in a male sibling, this is the most likely diagnosis. Confidence level: 95%

The other conditions listed previously would be less likely given the specific imaging findings and the family history provided. It is important to note that while the ""Martini glass"" sign is strongly suggestive of Norrie disease, a definitive diagnosis would require further clinical correlation and possibly genetic testing.",95,Excellent
2015,Oral Hemangioma,"Based on the content from the first link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10082015), we have limited clinical information about a 28-year-old woman with a left retromolar trigone mass that is increasing in size. Without more detailed clinical information or imaging findings, here are five initial differential diagnoses for an oropharyngeal mass:

1. Squamous cell carcinoma _ The most common type of oral cancer, which can present as a mass in the retromolar trigone area.
2. Minor salivary gland tumor _ Such as a pleomorphic adenoma or adenoid cystic carcinoma, which can occur in this region.
3. Soft tissue sarcoma _ A rare type of cancer that can occur in the connective tissues of the mouth.
4. Lymphoma _ A type of blood cancer that can present as a mass in the head and neck region.
5. Benign lesions _ Such as fibromas or mucoceles, which can present as masses but are non-cancerous.

After reviewing the additional information from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10082015/tab-legends), which describes the imaging findings of a nodular lesion in the left retromolar trigone with heterogeneous enhancement, well-defined borders, increased T2 signal with flow voids on STIR images, and heterogeneous enhancement on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images, the differential diagnosis can be refined. The presence of flow voids suggests a vascular component, which is more characteristic of certain lesions.

Revised differential diagnosis with confidence levels:

1. Squamous cell carcinoma _ Given the commonality of this cancer in the oral cavity and the described imaging features, this remains a strong possibility. Confidence level: 70%
2. Minor salivary gland tumor _ The heterogeneous enhancement and well-defined borders could fit with this diagnosis. Confidence level: 60%
3. Vascular malformation _ The presence of flow voids raises the possibility of a vascular lesion. Confidence level: 50%
4. Lymphoma _ Less likely given the imaging characteristics, but still a possibility in the differential. Confidence level: 40%
5. Benign vascular lesion _ Such as a hemangioma, although less common in adults. Confidence level: 30%

Without additional clinical details or imaging findings, here are five initial differential diagnoses for periorbital pain and swelling following trauma:

1. Orbital fracture _ Trauma can lead to fractures of the orbital bones, which can cause pain and swelling.
2. Subperiosteal hematoma _ A collection of blood beneath the periosteum of the orbital bones due to injury.
3. Orbital cellulitis _ An infection of the tissues surrounding the eye, which can occur after trauma if there is a breach in the skin.
4. Preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis _ An infection of the eyelid and surrounding skin, which can be secondary to trauma.
5. Foreign body _ Retained foreign material from the fall could cause pain and localized swelling.

After reviewing the additional information from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06112015/tab-legends), which describes the imaging findings of a well-delineated, linear-shaped right orbit foreign body extending from the extraconal postseptal fat into the cavernous sinus, with the same density as air at the soft tissue window, and denser inner structure on bone algorithm reconstructions, the differential diagnosis can be revised. The description clearly indicates the presence of a foreign body.

Revised differential diagnosis with confidence levels:

1. Foreign body _ Given the imaging findings of a linear-shaped object with air density extending into the cavernous sinus, this is the most likely diagnosis. Confidence level: 100%

The other conditions listed initially would be less likely given the specific imaging findings described. The presence of a foreign body is consistent with the history of trauma from a fall, and the imaging characteristics are definitive for this type of injury.

After reviewing the additional information from the diagram description provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08102015/tab-legends), which describes imaging findings of an acute infarct in the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) deep watershed territory, left distal cervical, petrous, cavernous, and clinoid internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion, diffuse intracranial atheromatosis, a left carotid-basilar anastomosis, complete absence of the cervical vertebral artery, and a hypoplastic right vertebral artery, the differential diagnosis can be revised.

Revised differential diagnosis with confidence levels:

1. Ischemic stroke due to left ICA occlusion and intracranial atheromatosis _ The imaging findings are consistent with an ischemic stroke in the left MCA territory. Confidence level: 95%
2. Moyamoya disease _ The presence of carotid-basilar anastomosis and collateral circulation could suggest Moyamoya, but the absence of the cervical vertebral artery and a hypoplastic right vertebral artery are not typical features. Confidence level: 70%
3. Arterial dissection _ This could lead to ICA occlusion, but the diffuse atheromatosis and collateral circulation patterns are more indicative of chronic vascular changes. Confidence level: 65%
4. Vasculitis _ Inflammation of the blood vessels can lead to stroke, but the imaging findings do not primarily suggest vasculitis. Confidence level: 60%
5. Cardiac embolism _ A cardiac source of emboli could cause an ischemic stroke, but the occlusion and atheromatosis suggest a primary vascular cause rather than an embolic one. Confidence level: 60%

Given the imaging findings described, the most likely diagnosis is an ischemic stroke due to left ICA occlusion and intracranial atheromatosis, with a confidence level of 95%. The presence of collateral circulation and the absence of typical vascular anatomy suggest a complex vascular pathology, but the acute infarct in the left MCA territory is the primary concern correlating with the patient's acute right hemiplegia.",95,Insufficient

Here are five initial differential diagnoses for these clinical findings:

1. Carotid artery dissection _ This can present with Horner syndrome and thunderclap headache due to disruption of the sympathetic plexus along the carotid sheath.
2. Subarachnoid hemorrhage _ A sudden and severe headache (thunderclap headache) is a classic presentation, and Horner syndrome may occur if the bleeding affects the sympathetic pathways.
3. Cerebral aneurysm _ An unruptured aneurysm can cause local pressure effects leading to Horner syndrome, and if it ruptures, it can present with a thunderclap headache.
4. Cluster headache _ This primary headache disorder can present with unilateral headache and autonomic symptoms, including Horner syndrome.
5. Pituitary apoplexy _ A sudden hemorrhage or infarction of the pituitary gland can present with a severe headache and may cause Horner syndrome due to cavernous sinus involvement.

2. Meningioma _ A benign brain tumor that can present with headaches and visual disturbances if it compresses adjacent structures.
3. Glioma _ A type of brain tumor that can affect the visual pathways or cause increased intracranial pressure leading to headaches.
4. Intracranial aneurysm _ An aneurysm can cause headaches and, if it compresses the optic pathways, visual disturbances.
5. Craniopharyngioma _ A benign tumor near the pituitary gland that can cause similar symptoms due to its location.

After reviewing the additional information from the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12312015/tab-legends), which describes the imaging findings of a large, lobulated, heterogeneously-enhancing pituitary mass with suprasellar extension, diffuse thickening of the calvarium with heterogeneous marrow signal, and hypodense nodules posterior and inferior to the thyroid lobes, the differential diagnosis can be revised. These findings suggest a pituitary mass with systemic involvement.

Revised differential diagnosis with confidence levels:

1. Pituitary macroadenoma with possible hyperpituitarism _ The pituitary mass and systemic findings could be related to hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma. Confidence level: 80%
2. Metastatic disease _ The diffuse calvarial thickening and nodules near the thyroid could suggest metastases, with the pituitary mass being a separate metastatic deposit. Confidence level: 60%
3. Multiple myeloma _ This could explain the calvarial thickening and marrow signal changes, with the pituitary mass being an unrelated finding or plasmacytoma. Confidence level: 50%
4. Lymphoma _ Can involve the pituitary and cause systemic findings, although less common. Confidence level: 40%
5. Sarcoidosis _ Can cause systemic granulomatous disease with pituitary involvement, but is less likely. Confidence level: 30%

After reviewing the additional information from the diagram description provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10262015/tab-legends), which describes imaging findings of an intradural extramedullary mass lesion causing spinal cord compression at the T9-T10 level, hyperintense on sagittal T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), hypointense on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and demonstrating solid, oval-shaped enhancement without a dural tail on postcontrast T1WI, the differential diagnosis can be revised.

Revised differential diagnosis with confidence levels:

1. Schwannoma _ The characteristics of the lesion being hyperintense on T1WI and enhancing solidly are typical for a schwannoma. Confidence level: 85%
2. Meningioma _ While meningiomas can enhance solidly, the lack of a dural tail makes this less likely. Confidence level: 70%
3. Metastatic disease _ Possible, but typically would have a more irregular enhancement pattern. Confidence level: 60%
4. Spinal ependymoma _ These are typically intramedullary but can occasionally present extramedullary. Confidence level: 50%
5. Spinal neurofibroma _ Similar to schwannoma, but less common as an isolated intradural extramedullary mass. Confidence level: 75%

The confidence levels reflect the likelihood of each diagnosis based on the imaging characteristics provided.

Revised differential diagnosis with confidence levels:

1. Optic neuritis _ The hyperintense T2 signal in the left optic nerve is suggestive, but the absence of classic MS lesions lowers the likelihood. Confidence level: 70%
2. Cerebrovascular accident (stroke) _ The acute infarction in the right parietal lobe could be related to the vision loss if it involves the visual pathways. Confidence level: 80%
3. Susac syndrome _ A rare condition that can cause encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions, and hearing loss, but typically involves the corpus callosum. Confidence level: 60%
4. Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) _ Can cause optic neuritis and central nervous system lesions, but typically spares the brain. Confidence level: 65%
5. Primary CNS vasculitis _ Could explain both the optic nerve and cerebral lesions, but is less common. Confidence level: 55%

The confidence levels reflect the likelihood of each diagnosis based on the combination of clinical presentation and imaging findings. The most likely diagnosis is a cerebrovascular event affecting the visual pathways, given the acute infarction in the right parietal lobe and the optic nerve signal abnormality. However, further clinical correlation, including a detailed ophthalmologic examination and possibly additional imaging or laboratory studies, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.",70,Good

The confidence level is not 100% due to the lack of complete clinical information, such as the duration of symptoms, presence of additional neurological signs, and laboratory findings, as well as the full spectrum of imaging sequences that would be necessary for a definitive diagnosis. However, the provided imaging findings and clinical context allow for a reasonably confident differential diagnosis.",85,Excellent
2014,Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 14-year-old boy with chronic diarrhea, bilateral Achilles tendon xanthomas, intellectual disability, and cerebellar ataxia as described in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05292014, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX)
2. Familial hypercholesterolemia
3. Niemann-Pick disease type C
4. Wilson's disease
5. Metachromatic leukodystrophy

After reviewing the additional content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05292014/tab-legends, which describes the imaging findings as fusiform enlargement of the Achilles tendon with interdigitating vertical striations and bilateral increased signal intensity in the cerebellar dentate nuclei on T2-weighted and FLAIR images, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) (most likely given the combination of symptoms and imaging findings)
2. Niemann-Pick disease type C (less likely given the specific imaging findings)
3. Metachromatic leukodystrophy (less likely given the specific imaging findings)
4. Hypothyroidism (can cause tendon xanthomas, but less likely with the cerebellar findings)
5. Mitochondrial disorders (can have a wide range of presentations, but less likely given the specific imaging findings)

The imaging findings of Achilles tendon enlargement with vertical striations and bilateral signal changes in the cerebellar dentate nuclei are highly suggestive of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), a rare autosomal recessive lipid storage disease characterized by the accumulation of cholestanol in various tissues, including the nervous system and tendons.

Confidence Level: 95%

The confidence level is high due to the characteristic combination of clinical and imaging findings that strongly suggest CTX. However, it is not 100% because the final diagnosis would require biochemical testing (e.g., serum cholestanol levels) and genetic testing to confirm the presence of mutations in the CYP27A1 gene, which is responsible for CTX.",95,Excellent
2014,Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP),"Based on the clinical presentation of a 37-year-old woman with quadriparesis and tremors as described in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07142014, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Multiple sclerosis
2. Neuromyelitis optica (NMO)
3. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)
4. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP)
5. Guillain-Barr_ syndrome

After reviewing the additional content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07142014/tab-legends, which describes the imaging findings as abnormal signal intensity lesions in the periventricular white matter on axial and sagittal FLAIR images, and bilateral symmetric enlarged nerve roots on coronal cervical and lumbar STIR images, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Multiple sclerosis (MS) (given the periventricular white matter lesions and neurological symptoms)
2. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) (considering the spinal cord involvement and nerve root enlargement)
3. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) (due to the symmetric nerve root enlargement)
4. Leukodystrophy (given the white matter changes, though less common in this age group)
5. Sarcoidosis (can cause both central nervous system and peripheral nerve involvement)

The imaging findings of periventricular white matter lesions and enlarged nerve roots suggest a demyelinating or inflammatory process that affects both the central and peripheral nervous systems.

Confidence Level: 80%

The confidence level is not 100% due to the lack of complete clinical information, such as the progression of symptoms, response to therapy, and additional laboratory findings, as well as the full spectrum of imaging sequences that would be necessary for a definitive diagnosis.

2014,Cisternal Racemose Neurocysticercosis,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 26-year-old man with a behavioral disorder, confusion, and speech abnormalities as described in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11202014, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Encephalitis
2. Neurosyphilis
3. Multiple sclerosis
4. Primary CNS lymphoma
5. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease

After reviewing the additional content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11202014/tab-legends, which describes the imaging findings as multiple cystic-appearing lesions in the cisternal spaces that are slightly more hyperintense than CSF on FLAIR images, and no diffusion restriction on DWI and corresponding ADC, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Neurocysticercosis
2. Arachnoid cysts
3. Meningeal carcinomatosis
4. Cystic brain metastases
5. Echinococcosis (hydatid cysts)

The imaging findings of multiple cystic-appearing lesions in the cisternal spaces without diffusion restriction suggest a parasitic infection such as neurocysticercosis or echinococcosis, or non-infectious cystic lesions such as arachnoid cysts. Meningeal carcinomatosis and cystic brain metastases are also considered, although they may typically show some diffusion restriction or different imaging characteristics.

Confidence Level: 85%

The confidence level is not 100% due to the lack of complete clinical information, such as the progression of symptoms, exposure history, and additional laboratory findings, as well as the full spectrum of imaging sequences that would be necessary for a definitive diagnosis.

2014,Congenital Cytomegalovirus Infection,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 2-year-old child with developmental delay as described in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10202014, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Congenital infection (e.g., cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis)
2. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy
3. Metabolic disorder (e.g., leukodystrophy)
4. Genetic syndrome with CNS involvement (e.g., Tuberous sclerosis)
5. Intracranial hemorrhage with subsequent hydrocephalus

After reviewing the additional content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10202014/tab-legends, which describes the imaging findings as noncontrast axial and coronal CT scans demonstrating ventriculomegaly, ill-defined white matter hypodensities, and periventricular calcifications, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Congenital infection (e.g., cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis) (given the periventricular calcifications)
2. Congenital Zika syndrome (given the ventriculomegaly and calcifications)
3. Congenital rubella syndrome (less common but can present with similar findings)
4. Aicardi-Gouti_res syndrome (a rare genetic disorder that can present with calcifications and white matter changes)
5. Sturge-Weber syndrome (less likely without mention of facial port-wine stain or leptomeningeal angioma)

The imaging findings of ventriculomegaly, white matter hypodensities, and periventricular calcifications are highly suggestive of a congenital infection, particularly cytomegalovirus or toxoplasmosis, which are known to cause such changes in the developing brain.

Confidence Level: 90%

The confidence level is high due to the characteristic imaging findings that strongly suggest a congenital infection. However, it is not 100% because definitive diagnosis would require serological testing and possibly further imaging or genetic testing to confirm the specific etiology and to rule out other rare conditions.",90,Excellent
2014,Cytomegalovirus-Associated Ventriculitis and Chorioretinitis,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 33-year-old Hispanic man with HIV presenting with increasing weakness, lethargy, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and blindness for the past few weeks as described in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09292014, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. HIV-associated opportunistic central nervous system (CNS) infection (e.g., toxoplasmosis, cryptococcosis)
2. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)
3. CNS lymphoma
4. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis with CNS involvement
5. HIV encephalopathy

After reviewing the additional content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09292014/tab-legends, which describes the imaging findings as restricted diffusion along the ependymal surface of the lateral ventricles, faint enhancement at these sites on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), thickened uvea bilaterally, and a suggestion of right-sided retinal detachment, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection with CNS involvement (given the retinal detachment and CNS findings)
2. HIV-associated opportunistic CNS infection (e.g., cryptococcal meningitis, considering the ependymal enhancement)
3. CNS lymphoma (can present with ependymal enhancement and may be associated with ocular involvement)
4. Neurosyphilis (can cause ocular symptoms and CNS abnormalities, especially in immunocompromised patients)
5. Tuberculous meningitis (can cause ependymal enhancement and may have ocular manifestations)

The imaging findings of ependymal enhancement and ocular involvement, particularly in an HIV-positive patient, suggest an opportunistic infection such as CMV, which is known to cause retinitis and can also involve the CNS.

Confidence Level: 90%

The confidence level is high due to the specific imaging findings and the patient's immunocompromised status, which make opportunistic infections a likely diagnosis. However, it is not 100% because definitive diagnosis would require further clinical correlation, laboratory testing (e.g., PCR, cultures), and possibly ocular examination to confirm the specific etiology.",90,Excellent
2014,Dental Implant Migration,"Based on the initial content summary from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08142014, we have a case involving a 59-year-old man who was referred to the emergency department by his oral surgeon after a dental implant ""went missing."" Without specific imaging findings, it is challenging to provide differential diagnoses. However, considering the context, we can speculate on potential scenarios:

1. Displacement of the dental implant into the maxillary sinus
2. Aspiration of the dental implant into the respiratory tract
3. Swallowing of the dental implant into the gastrointestinal tract
4. Retention of the dental implant in the oral soft tissues
5. Infection or abscess formation secondary to the dental procedure

After reviewing the additional content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08142014/tab-legends, which describes the imaging findings as a hyperdense foreign body in the left maxillary sinus on a coronal CT scan, with the missing dental implant causing secondary mucosal thickening and reactive inflammatory change within the left maxillary sinus, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Displacement of the dental implant into the maxillary sinus (Confirmed by imaging)
2. Maxillary sinusitis secondary to foreign body reaction (Confirmed by imaging)
3. Osteomyelitis of the maxilla secondary to dental implant displacement (Possible complication)
4. Oroantral fistula formation secondary to dental implant displacement (Possible complication)
5. Chronic sinusitis with potential for superimposed acute infection due to the foreign body (Possible complication)

The imaging findings confirm the displacement of the dental implant into the left maxillary sinus and the associated inflammatory changes, which is consistent with the clinical scenario described.

Confidence Level: 100%

The confidence level is 100% for the diagnosis of a displaced dental implant into the maxillary sinus, as the imaging findings clearly depict the foreign body and its location, as well as the secondary effects on the surrounding sinus mucosa.",100,Excellent
2014,Desmoplastic Infantile Ganglioglioma,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 7-month-old male infant with macrocephaly, dilated scalp veins, mild sunsetting, and bulging fontanelles as described in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08072014, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Hydrocephalus
2. Vein of Galen malformation
3. Arachnoid cyst
4. Congenital brain tumor (e.g., teratoma)
5. Subdural hematoma

After reviewing the additional content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08072014/tab-legends, which describes the imaging findings as a large multilobulated cystic mass predominantly within the left frontoparietal lobes with significant mass effect on the adjacent brain parenchyma, a peripheral solid component that enhances intensely on postgadolinium coronal T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), axial T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) demonstrating multiple internal septations within this mass lesion, extensive vasogenic edema, and marked left-to-right subfalcine herniation, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Congenital brain tumor (e.g., teratoma, craniopharyngioma)
2. Intracranial cystic neoplasm (e.g., cystic astrocytoma)
3. Porencephalic cyst with associated mass effect
4. Infectious process with abscess formation
5. Intracranial hemorrhage with subsequent cystic encephalomalacia

The imaging findings of a cystic mass with a solid enhancing component and significant mass effect are suggestive of a neoplastic process, possibly a congenital brain tumor such as a teratoma or craniopharyngioma. The presence of internal septations and extensive edema also raises the possibility of a cystic neoplasm or an infectious process.

Confidence Level: 85%

The confidence level is not 100% due to the lack of complete clinical information, such as the progression of symptoms, presence of systemic signs, and laboratory findings, as well as the full spectrum of imaging sequences that would be necessary for a definitive diagnosis.

2014,Developmental Venous Anomaly,"Based on the limited clinical information provided in the first JSON data block, which only mentions a 65-year-old with a headache, it is challenging to provide a specific list of differential diagnoses. However, common causes of headache in this age group can include:

1. Migraine
2. Tension-type headache
3. Temporal arteritis (giant cell arteritis)
4. Subarachnoid hemorrhage
5. Intracranial mass lesion (e.g., tumor, metastasis)

After reviewing the additional content from the second JSON data block, which describes the imaging findings as an enhancing lesion in the midline at the region of the foramen of Monro with vessels seen coursing to this lesion, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Colloid cyst of the third ventricle
2. Central neurocytoma
3. Subependymoma
4. Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA)
5. Meningioma

The imaging findings of an enhancing lesion at the foramen of Monro with associated vessels suggest a neoplastic process. Colloid cysts are commonly found in this location and can cause obstructive hydrocephalus leading to headaches. Central neurocytomas and subependymomas are also intraventricular tumors that can present similarly. SEGAs are typically associated with tuberous sclerosis and can occur near the foramen of Monro. Meningiomas, although less common in this location, can also present with similar imaging characteristics.

Confidence Level: 85%

The confidence level is not 100% due to the lack of complete clinical information, such as the duration and characteristics of the headache, neurological examination findings, and additional imaging details that would be necessary for a definitive diagnosis. However, the provided imaging findings and the patient's age allow for a reasonably confident differential diagnosis.",85,Insufficient
2014,Diffuse Infiltrating Retinoblastoma,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 14-year-old girl with a 2-year history of left proptosis as described in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10062014, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Orbital cellulitis
2. Thyroid eye disease (Graves' ophthalmopathy)

4. Optic nerve glioma
5. Rhabdomyosarcoma

After reviewing the additional content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10062014/tab-legends, which describes the imaging findings as diffuse thickening and enhancement of the posterior wall and the anterior chamber, thickening of the optic nerve and periorbital soft tissues, including the lacrimal gland, invasion of the lesion into the sclera and the inferior eyelid, moderate enhancement of all these components, and histopathology revealing an intra and extraocular poorly differentiated retinoblastoma with necrosis in 40% of the cells and no calcifications, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Retinoblastoma (Confirmed by histopathology)
2. Orbital metastasis (e.g., from neuroblastoma)
3. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor
4. Lymphoma
5. Leukemic infiltrate

The imaging and histopathological findings confirm the diagnosis of retinoblastoma, which is a primary malignant intraocular tumor that can cause proptosis and may extend to the optic nerve and surrounding structures.

Confidence Level: 100%

The confidence level is 100% for the diagnosis of retinoblastoma, as the histopathological findings provided in the content confirm the diagnosis. The presence of necrosis and the lack of calcifications are consistent with poorly differentiated retinoblastoma.",100,Excellent
2014,Down Syndrome with Atlantoaxial Instability and Persistent Ossiculum Terminale,"Based on the clinical presentation of an 11-year-old girl with Down syndrome and the imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11032014, which include atlantoaxial instability and a hypoplastic dens with a suggestion of persistent ossiculum terminale and signal abnormality within the cord suggestive of cord edema or myelomalacia, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Atlantoaxial subluxation due to ligamentous laxity associated with Down syndrome
2. Os odontoideum with associated myelopathy
3. Rheumatoid arthritis with cervical spine involvement
4. Congenital malformation of the cervical spine
5. Traumatic injury to the cervical spine

After reviewing the additional content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11032014/tab-legends, which provides further details on the imaging findings, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Atlantoaxial subluxation due to ligamentous laxity associated with Down syndrome (most likely given the patient's history and imaging findings)
2. Os odontoideum with associated myelopathy (possible given the hypoplastic dens and signal abnormality in the cord)
3. Morquio syndrome (a type of mucopolysaccharidosis that can present with atlantoaxial instability)
4. Grisel's syndrome (non-traumatic atlantoaxial subluxation often associated with inflammatory processes in the head and neck)
5. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis with cervical spine involvement (less likely given the patient's Down syndrome, but can cause similar findings)

The imaging findings of atlantoaxial instability, hypoplastic dens, and signal abnormality within the spinal cord are highly suggestive of a condition related to ligamentous laxity, which is common in individuals with Down syndrome.

Confidence Level: 95%

The confidence level is high due to the strong correlation between the patient's known diagnosis of Down syndrome and the characteristic imaging findings of atlantoaxial instability. However, it is not 100% because other rare conditions could potentially present with similar imaging findings, and a definitive diagnosis would require clinical correlation and potentially further investigation.",95,Excellent
2014,Dysmorphic Ear Ossicles in Fanconi Anemia,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 25-year-old woman with known Fanconi anemia presenting with hearing loss, and the imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07032014/tab-legends, which include dysmorphic left middle ear ossicles with fusion of the handle of the malleus to the long process of the incus, narrowing of the left external auditory canal (EAC) with an atretic bony plate fused with the handle of malleus, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Congenital aural atresia
2. Ossicular chain malformation or dysplasia
3. Chronic otitis media with ossicular erosion or fixation
4. Otosclerosis
5. Tympanosclerosis

After reviewing the diagram description, which confirms the presence of dysmorphic and fused ossicles and narrowing of the EAC with an atretic bony plate, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Congenital aural atresia with ossicular malformation (most likely given the atretic bony plate and ossicular fusion)
2. Ossicular chain dysplasia associated with Fanconi anemia (possible given the patient's known diagnosis)
3. External auditory canal stenosis secondary to chronic inflammation or previous surgery
4. Fibrous dysplasia affecting the temporal bone (less likely given the specific ossicular involvement)
5. Cholesteatoma causing ossicular erosion or fixation (less likely given the absence of mention of a mass)

The imaging findings of ossicular dysmorphia and EAC narrowing with an atretic bony plate are highly suggestive of a congenital malformation, which could be associated with the patient's known condition of Fanconi anemia.

Confidence Level: 90%

The confidence level is high due to the specific imaging findings that strongly suggest a congenital malformation, which is consistent with the patient's presentation and known diagnosis of Fanconi anemia. However, it is not 100% because other rare conditions could potentially present with similar imaging findings, and a definitive diagnosis would require clinical correlation and potentially further investigation.",90,Excellent
2014,Endophthalmitis,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 54-year-old man with pancytopenia presenting with left eye swelling, photophobia, excessive tearing, blurry vision, and frontal headache as described in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09222014, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Orbital cellulitis

4. Orbital lymphoma
5. Thyroid eye disease (Graves' ophthalmopathy)

After reviewing the additional content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09222014/tab-legends, which describes the imaging findings as preseptal soft-tissue swelling and inflammation with postseptal infiltration involving the left orbit, asymmetric chorioretinal/scleral enhancement, enlargement of the anterior chamber suggestive of increased intraocular pressure, restricted diffusion in the posterior aspect of the left globe and lateral intraconal space on DWI, and deformity of the left ocular globe with a suggestion of exudative retinal detachment, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Infectious endophthalmitis with orbital cellulitis (given the acute presentation and restricted diffusion suggesting an infectious process)
2. Orbital abscess with secondary ocular involvement (due to the presence of restricted diffusion and postseptal inflammation)
3. Necrotizing fasciitis of the orbit (a severe infection that can cause rapid tissue damage)
4. Mucormycosis (especially in the context of pancytopenia and immunosuppression)
5. Intraocular lymphoma with secondary orbital involvement (considering the patient's age and the presence of pancytopenia)

The imaging findings of inflammation involving both preseptal and postseptal spaces, along with intraocular changes, are suggestive of a severe infectious or inflammatory process, possibly with an underlying immunocompromised state given the pancytopenia.

Confidence Level: 85%

The confidence level is not 100% due to the lack of specific clinical details such as the patient's immune status, fever, or other systemic symptoms, as well as the full spectrum of imaging sequences that would be necessary for a definitive diagnosis.

4. Otitis media with effusion
5. Otosclerosis

After reviewing the additional content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06092014/tab-legends, which describes the imaging findings as a lobulated soft tissue mass within the right tympanic cavity along the course of the labyrinthine and tympanic segments of the facial nerve, with near homogeneous enhancement of this mass on coronal T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and contrast-enhanced coronal T2WI, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Facial nerve schwannoma (given the location along the course of the facial nerve and imaging characteristics)
2. Glomus tympanicum tumor (paraganglioma, typically found in the middle ear and may enhance homogeneously)
3. Middle ear carcinoma (rare, but can present as a mass in the tympanic cavity)
4. Cholesteatoma (less likely given the enhancement pattern, but can appear as a mass)
5. Chronic otitis media with granulation tissue (can cause a mass-like effect and enhance)

The imaging findings of a lobulated, enhancing mass along the course of the facial nerve segments within the tympanic cavity are most suggestive of a facial nerve schwannoma.

Confidence Level: 90%

The confidence level is high due to the specific imaging findings that strongly suggest a mass lesion involving the facial nerve, with facial nerve schwannoma being a leading consideration. However, it is not 100% because other rare tumors or inflammatory processes could potentially present with similar imaging findings, and a definitive diagnosis would require clinical correlation and potentially further investigation, such as biopsy.",90,Excellent
2014,Fat Embolism,"Based on the initial content summary from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09042014, which describes a 76-year-old woman who underwent left radial and ulnar open reduction and internal fixation following a fall and was found stuporous two days later, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

4. Hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic stroke
5. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy

After reviewing the additional content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09042014/tab-legends, which describes the imaging findings as a post-op left arm X-ray with radial and cubital osteosynthesis, a chest X-ray (CXR) revealing diffuse, bilateral interstitial lung edema, and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) revealing multiple bilateral scattered subcortical foci of restricted diffusion, with symmetric restricted diffusion involving the globus pallidi, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Cerebral fat embolism syndrome (given the recent orthopedic surgery, lung edema, and typical DWI findings)
2. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (possible given the stuporous state and bilateral DWI changes)
3. Multiple embolic strokes (considering the multiple foci of restricted diffusion)
4. Metabolic encephalopathy (e.g., uremia, hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause bilateral DWI changes)
5. Infectious or septic encephalopathy (considering the postoperative state and potential for systemic infection)

The imaging findings of bilateral interstitial lung edema and multiple scattered subcortical foci of restricted diffusion, particularly involving the globus pallidi, are highly suggestive of cerebral fat embolism syndrome, which can occur after long bone fractures and orthopedic procedures.

Confidence Level: 95%

The confidence level is high due to the characteristic clinical presentation and imaging findings that strongly suggest cerebral fat embolism syndrome. However, it is not 100% because other conditions can mimic these findings, and a definitive diagnosis would require clinical correlation and exclusion of other potential causes.",95,Excellent
2014,Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva,"Based on the provided description of a 14-year-old boy with a neck mass from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03172014, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Lymphadenopathy (reactive or neoplastic)
2. Branchial cleft cyst
3. Thyroglossal duct cyst
4. Cervical teratoma
5. Soft tissue sarcoma (e.g., rhabdomyosarcoma)

After reviewing the additional content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03172014/tab-legends, which describes the imaging findings as a soft tissue mass centered in the left suboccipital and paraspinal areas, extending from the skull base to the base of the neck, with striated density within the lesion and multifocal calcifications in the left pectoralis minor and the left subscapularis muscles, as well as tubular bony density extending from the greater tuberosity of the humeral head to the midshaft of the humerus laterally, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Soft tissue sarcoma with calcifications (e.g., synovial sarcoma)
2. Myositis ossificans (given the striated density and calcifications within the muscle)
3. Fibromatosis (desmoid tumor)
4. Neurofibromatosis type I (given the presence of a paraspinal mass and possible neurofibromas)
5. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (can present with soft tissue masses and bony lesions)

The imaging findings of a soft tissue mass with striated density and multifocal calcifications, as well as the tubular bony density, suggest a proliferative or neoplastic process, possibly involving the musculoskeletal system.

Confidence Level: 80%

The confidence level is not 100% due to the lack of complete clinical information, such as the presence of pain, rate of growth of the mass, and any associated systemic symptoms, as well as the full spectrum of imaging sequences that would be necessary for a definitive diagnosis.

2014,Fibrous Dysplasia of the Middle Turbinate,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08042014, the clinical context is a 45-year-old man with nasal stuffiness. Without specific imaging findings or additional clinical details, I can offer a list of five differential diagnoses that could potentially explain nasal stuffiness:

1. Chronic rhinosinusitis
2. Nasal polyposis
3. Deviated nasal septum
4. Turbinate hypertrophy
5. Neoplastic processes (benign or malignant)

After reviewing the additional imaging findings provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08042014/tab-legends, which describe an axial CT scan, reconstructed coronal, and sagittal CT scans demonstrating a markedly enlarged left middle turbinate with ground glass density and a deviated nasal septum to the right, the differential diagnoses can be refined:

1. Concha bullosa (pneumatized turbinate) - Given the description of an enlarged left middle turbinate with ground glass density, this could represent air within the turbinate, which is characteristic of concha bullosa.
2. Inflammatory sinus disease - The ground glass density may indicate inflammation or infection.
3. Nasal polyposis - Polyps can sometimes present with a ground glass appearance and cause turbinate enlargement.
4. Antrochoanal polyp - A benign cystic lesion arising from the maxillary sinus that can extend into the nasal cavity and cause turbinate enlargement.
5. Sinonasal tumor - While less likely, a neoplastic process could present with turbinate enlargement and should be considered.

Confidence Level: 80%

The confidence level reflects the likelihood that the imaging findings correlate with the listed differential diagnoses, considering the typical presentation of these conditions. However, further clinical correlation and potentially additional imaging or endoscopic evaluation would be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis.",80,Insufficient
2014,Fogging Effect,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 69-year-old man with transient dysarthria, vertigo, and right hemiparesis, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Ischemic stroke
2. Transient ischemic attack (TIA)
3. Hemorrhagic stroke
4. Brain tumor causing mass effect and edema
5. Demyelinating disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis)

After reviewing the additional content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03102014/tab-legends, which describes the imaging findings as faint hypodensity in the left paramedian aspect of the pons on an axial CT scan at admission, confirmed acute infarct in the same area on axial DWI and FLAIR 4 days later, and chronic infarction at the 3-month follow-up MRI, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Ischemic stroke in the territory of the basilar artery (confirmed by imaging findings)
2. Lacunar infarct (given the location in the pons and the size of the lesion)
3. Vertebrobasilar insufficiency (given the transient symptoms and pontine infarct)
4. Small vessel disease (considering the patient's age and the location of the infarct)
5. Brainstem glioma (less likely given the resolution of symptoms and lack of progression)

The imaging findings of an acute infarct in the pons with subsequent evolution into a chronic infarct are consistent with an ischemic stroke, likely due to small vessel disease or vertebrobasilar insufficiency.

Confidence Level: 95%

The confidence level is high due to the clear imaging evidence of an acute infarct in the pons, which correlates with the patient's clinical presentation of transient neurological deficits. The subsequent imaging showing chronic infarction supports the diagnosis of ischemic stroke. However, it is not 100% because other rare conditions could potentially mimic these findings, and a definitive diagnosis would require clinical correlation and consideration of the patient's full medical history and risk factors.",95,Insufficient
2014,Gardner Syndrome,"Based on the history of multiple adenomas on colonoscopy and the imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04072014, which describe axial CT scans showing multiple osteomas involving the skull vault, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Gardner syndrome (associated with familial adenomatous polyposis and osteomas)
2. Multiple hereditary exostoses (characterized by multiple osteochondromas)
3. Osteoma cutis (multiple small bone formations in the skin)
4. Osteoblastoma (benign bone tumor, less likely to be multiple)
5. Osteosarcoma (malignant bone tumor, typically not presenting as multiple lesions)

After reviewing the additional content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04072014/tab-legends, which confirms the presence of multiple osteomas on the skull vault, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Gardner syndrome (most likely given the association with colon adenomas and multiple osteomas)
2. Multiple hereditary exostoses (less likely given the specific association with colon adenomas)
3. Osteoma cutis (possible but typically presents with smaller lesions)
4. Metastatic disease to the skull (less likely given the benign appearance of the osteomas)
5. Fibrous dysplasia (can cause multiple bone lesions but has a different imaging appearance)

The combination of multiple adenomas on colonoscopy and multiple osteomas involving the skull vault is highly suggestive of Gardner syndrome, a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis.

Confidence Level: 95%

The confidence level is high due to the strong correlation between the patient's known history of multiple adenomas and the characteristic imaging findings of multiple osteomas, which are hallmarks of Gardner syndrome. However, it is not 100% because other rare conditions could potentially present with similar imaging findings, and a definitive diagnosis would require genetic testing and clinical correlation.",95,Excellent

1. Meningioma (given the extra-axial location, hyperintensity on T2WI, and scalloping of the skull)
2. Arachnoid cyst (considering the CSF-like intensity on FLAIR)
3. Dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) (given the flow void and venous structure seen on imaging)
4. Hemangiopericytoma (a vascular tumor that can show similar imaging features)
5. Lymphoma (less likely given the imaging characteristics but included due to the mass effect)

The imaging findings of a lesion with a flow void and involvement of the venous sinus are suggestive of a vascular lesion such as a DAVF or a tumor with prominent vascularity like a meningioma.

Confidence Level: 85%

The confidence level is not 100% due to the potential overlap in imaging characteristics between different vascular and neoplastic lesions. However, the provided imaging findings and clinical context allow for a reasonably confident differential diagnosis.",85,Insufficient

1. Cerebral toxoplasmosis (common in HIV-positive patients, can present with ring-enhancing lesions)
2. CNS lymphoma (can appear as a mass with enhancement in immunocompromised patients)
3. Tuberculoma (can calcify and cause seizures, especially in endemic areas)
4. Cerebral abscess (can present with ring enhancement and surrounding edema)
5. Calcified chronic subdural hematoma (given the hemosiderin rim, though less common with calcification)

The imaging findings of a calcified mass with a surrounding hemosiderin rim and heterogeneous enhancement are suggestive of an infectious or neoplastic process, with cerebral toxoplasmosis and CNS lymphoma being high on the list for an HIV-positive patient.

Confidence Level: 85%

The confidence level is not 100% due to the potential overlap in imaging characteristics between different infectious, neoplastic, and inflammatory conditions. However, the provided imaging findings and the patient's immunocompromised status allow for a reasonably confident differential diagnosis.",85,Insufficient

4. Central giant cell granuloma (can present as a lytic lesion in the maxilla)
5. Aneurysmal bone cyst (can show expansile growth and enhancement, though typically more heterogeneous)

The imaging findings of an expansile lytic lesion with homogeneous enhancement in the maxilla of a young patient suggest a benign but locally aggressive odontogenic or bone-related tumor.

Confidence Level: 90%

The confidence level is high due to the characteristic imaging findings that are suggestive of a benign odontogenic or bone-related tumor. However, it is not 100% because the final diagnosis would require histopathological confirmation, and other rare entities could potentially present with similar imaging characteristics.",90,Excellent

5. Stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic)

After reviewing the additional content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12012014/tab-legends, which describes the imaging findings as a huge left middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm with a tortuous channel, 3D reconstruction showing both sides of the aneurysm connected to the MCA branches, and conventional angiography confirming an irregular, dilated, serpiginous, partially thrombosed arterial vascular channel originating from the left M2 segment, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Giant cerebral aneurysm (most likely given the imaging findings)
2. Fusiform aneurysm (given the irregular, dilated, serpiginous appearance)
3. Dissecting aneurysm (could present with a similar appearance)
4. Partially thrombosed aneurysm (as suggested by the imaging description)
5. Arteriovenous malformation with aneurysmal component (less likely given the description, but possible)

The imaging findings of a huge aneurysm with a tortuous channel and partial thrombosis are highly suggestive of a giant cerebral aneurysm, particularly involving the MCA.

Confidence Level: 95%

The confidence level is high due to the specific imaging findings that strongly suggest a giant cerebral aneurysm. However, it is not 100% because other vascular abnormalities could potentially present with similar imaging characteristics, and a definitive diagnosis would require clinical correlation and consideration of the patient's full medical history and risk factors.",95,Good

2. Cystic periventricular leukomalacia
3. Neurocysticercosis
4. Multiple sclerosis (MS) with cystic lesions
5. Lacunar infarcts with subsequent cystic degeneration

After reviewing the diagram description, which emphasizes the distribution along the path of the perforating medullary arteries and the normal appearance of the adjacent brain parenchyma, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Virchow-Robin spaces (enlarged perivascular spaces) (most likely given the distribution along medullary arteries and CSF-like signal)
2. Cystic periventricular leukomalacia (less likely given the normal adjacent parenchyma)
3. Neurocysticercosis (less likely without identifiable solid component or enhancement)
4. Lacunar infarcts with subsequent cystic degeneration (less likely given the multicystic nature and lack of surrounding gliosis)
5. Developmental cystic anomalies (e.g., schizencephaly, but typically associated with other brain malformations)

The imaging findings are most suggestive of enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces, which are benign and often incidental findings on MRI that follow the course of penetrating arteries and have CSF signal intensity.

Confidence Level: 95%

The confidence level is high due to the characteristic imaging appearance of the lesions and their distribution along the path of the perforating medullary arteries, which is typical for enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces.

1. Leukemic infiltration of the spine (given the patient's history of AML and the presence of an enhancing mass)
2. Lymphoma (can present similarly with intraspinal soft-tissue masses)
3. Epidural abscess (considering the enhancing nature of the lesion, though less likely without fever or elevated inflammatory markers)
4. Metastatic disease (possible in a patient with a known malignancy)
5. Spinal meningioma (can cause scalloping and present as an enhancing intraspinal mass)

The imaging findings of a lobulated soft-tissue mass with vertebral scalloping and enhancement are suggestive of a neoplastic process, with leukemic infiltration being a leading consideration due to the patient's known diagnosis of AML.

Confidence Level: 90%

The confidence level is high due to the correlation between the patient's history of AML and the imaging findings indicative of a neoplastic process. However, it is not 100% because other conditions can mimic these findings, and a definitive diagnosis would require further investigation, potentially including biopsy and laboratory tests.",90,Good

4. Hajdu-Cheney syndrome (known for acro-osteolysis and basilar invagination)
5. Raine syndrome (a rare genetic disorder with craniofacial anomalies and skeletal dysplasia)

The combination of craniofacial and skeletal abnormalities, particularly the presence of wormian bones and acro-osteolysis, is suggestive of a genetic syndrome affecting bone development and density.

Confidence Level: 90%

The confidence level is high due to the specific constellation of imaging findings that point towards a genetic syndrome with skeletal dysplasia. However, it is not 100% because the final diagnosis would require genetic testing and clinical correlation to confirm the specific syndrome.",90,Excellent

1. Diabetic striatopathy (hyperglycemic hemiballismus) (most likely given the clinical context and imaging findings)
2. Wilson's disease (can cause T1 hyperintensity in the basal ganglia, but less likely given the patient's age and lack of other typical features)
3. Hepatic encephalopathy (can cause T1 hyperintensity in the basal ganglia, but other clinical signs would be expected)
4. Carbon monoxide poisoning (can lead to T1 hyperintensity in the globus pallidus, but the putamen is less commonly involved)
5. Metabolic or toxic encephalopathy (various substances or metabolic derangements can cause T1 hyperintensity in the basal ganglia)

The imaging findings of T1 hyperintensity in the putamen without corresponding T2 or DWI abnormalities are characteristic of diabetic striatopathy, which is associated with non-ketotic hyperglycemia and can present with hemiballismus or chorea.

Confidence Level: 95%

The confidence level is high due to the specific imaging findings and the patient's clinical history of diabetes and involuntary movements, which are strongly suggestive of diabetic striatopathy.

1. Hirayama disease (also known as monomelic amyotrophy, given the focal cord atrophy, and dynamic changes with flexion)
2. Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (considering the cord signal changes and atrophy)
3. Spinal cord arteriovenous malformation (AVM) (possible given the signal changes and cord atrophy)
4. Spinal cord infarction (myelomalacia could be due to ischemia)
5. Inflammatory or infectious myelitis (less likely given the chronicity and lack of systemic signs)

The imaging findings of dynamic changes with flexion and extension, focal cord atrophy, and myelomalacia are highly suggestive of Hirayama disease, which is a rare, non-progressive neurological disorder that predominantly affects young males and leads to muscle weakness and atrophy in the upper limbs.

Confidence Level: 95%

The confidence level is high due to the specific imaging findings that strongly suggest Hirayama disease, especially the dynamic changes with flexion and extension and the pattern of atrophy and myelomalacia.

3. Hyperammonemic encephalopathy from other causes (e.g., medications, gastrointestinal bleeding)
4. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) (less likely given the sparing of the occipital lobes)
5. Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy secondary to medications or toxins (possible but would need specific history)

The imaging findings of bilateral symmetric cortical diffusion restriction with sparing of specific brain regions are suggestive of a metabolic encephalopathy, with hepatic encephalopathy being the leading consideration due to the patient's history and laboratory findings.

Confidence Level: 95%

The confidence level is high due to the strong correlation between the patient's known history of hepatic cirrhosis, elevated ammonia level, and the characteristic imaging findings of hepatic encephalopathy.

3. Aqueductal stenosis (a possible cause of ventricular dilatation with normal-sized third and fourth ventricles)
4. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH, pseudotumor cerebri, which can cause headaches and visual symptoms)
5. Intracranial mass effect causing secondary hydrocephalus (e.g., colloid cyst blocking the foramen of Monro)

The imaging findings of dilated lateral ventricles with normal-sized third and fourth ventricles suggest an obstruction at the level of the foramen of Monro or the cerebral aqueduct, leading to obstructive hydrocephalus.

Confidence Level: 90%

The confidence level is high due to the specific imaging findings that suggest an obstructive process leading to hydrocephalus. However, it is not 100% because other conditions can cause similar imaging findings, and a definitive diagnosis would require further investigation, potentially including MRI with flow studies or CT ventriculography to identify the exact site and cause of obstruction.",90,Good

2014,Infantile Krabbe Disease (KD),"Based on the clinical presentation of a 5-month-old boy with progressive irritability, stiffness, continuous crying, and abnormal eye movements, and the imaging findings described in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02132014/tab-legends, which include symmetric hyperintensity in the frontal and parietal white matter on axial T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and axial FLAIR, abnormal signal involving the white matter diffusely at the level of the internal capsule, hyperintense signal involving the thalami bilaterally, and no appreciable enhancement on postcontrast axial T1-weighted MRI (T1WI), here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Leukodystrophy (e.g., metachromatic leukodystrophy, Krabbe disease)
2. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy
3. Mitochondrial disorder (e.g., Leigh syndrome)
4. Infection (e.g., congenital CMV, herpes simplex encephalitis)
5. Inborn errors of metabolism (e.g., urea cycle disorders)

After reviewing the diagram description, which confirms the presence of symmetric white matter hyperintensities and involvement of the thalami without enhancement, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Leukodystrophy (most likely given the symmetric white matter changes and age of presentation)
2. Mitochondrial disorder (e.g., Leigh syndrome, considering the bilateral thalamic involvement)
3. Infection (less likely given the lack of enhancement, but congenital infections can have similar imaging)
4. Inborn errors of metabolism (considering the age and diffuse white matter involvement)
5. Glutaric aciduria type I (can present with frontotemporal atrophy and white matter changes)

The imaging findings of symmetric white matter hyperintensities, particularly involving the thalami, and the lack of enhancement are suggestive of a metabolic or genetic condition affecting the white matter, with leukodystrophy being high on the list.

Confidence Level: 90%

The confidence level is high due to the characteristic imaging findings that strongly suggest a leukodystrophy or related metabolic disorder. However, it is not 100% because other rare conditions could potentially present with similar imaging findings, and a definitive diagnosis would require further clinical correlation, laboratory testing, and potentially genetic testing.",90,Excellent

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10272014/tab-legends, which describes hyperdense lesions within the right cerebral hemisphere on axial CT scan, hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted MRI without diffusion restriction, heterogeneous enhancement following contrast administration, and increased relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), the differential diagnoses can be refined:

1. Metastatic brain lesions (confidence level: 85%) - The imaging findings could be consistent with metastases, especially considering the patient's history of prostate cancer.
2. High-grade glioma (e.g., glioblastoma) (confidence level: 75%) - The increased rCBV and heterogeneous enhancement are suggestive of a high-grade primary brain tumor.
3. Radiation necrosis (confidence level: 80%) - The lack of diffusion restriction and the patient's history of radiation therapy make this a strong possibility.
4. Primary CNS lymphoma (confidence level: 70%) - Can present with similar imaging findings, though less common in the absence of immunodeficiency.
5. Infectious or inflammatory process (e.g., abscess, encephalitis) (confidence level: 65%) - While the imaging findings are not typical for infection, it cannot be completely ruled out without further clinical correlation.

The confidence levels are adjusted based on the imaging characteristics and the patient's clinical history. The presence of increased rCBV and heterogeneous enhancement are more suggestive of a neoplastic process, with metastatic brain lesions and radiation necrosis being the most likely given the patient's history of prostate cancer and treatment. Further clinical correlation, laboratory tests, and possibly a biopsy would be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis.",85,Good
2014,Nasal Dermal Sinus (with Incidental Associated Nasal Fracture),"Based on the clinical presentation of a 6-year-old boy with painful focal nasal swelling and a clear liquid discharge positive for glucose, suggestive of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), following minor trauma to the face, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10022014, here are five differential diagnoses:

1. Post-traumatic CSF leak (confidence level: 85%) - The history of trauma and positive glucose test for CSF are highly suggestive of a CSF leak.
2. Encephalocele (confidence level: 70%) - A defect in the skull that allows brain tissue to protrude can present with nasal swelling, though it is usually congenital.
3. Sinusitis with mucocele formation (confidence level: 60%) - Can cause nasal swelling and discharge, but the presence of CSF is not typical.
4. Nasal dermoid cyst (confidence level: 50%) - A congenital lesion that can present with nasal swelling, but clear fluid discharge would be unusual.
5. Nasal glioma (confidence level: 45%) - A rare congenital mass that does not typically present with CSF leakage.

1. Post-traumatic CSF leak (confidence level: 95%) - The imaging findings of an enlarged foramen cecum and fluid tracking through a defect in the nasal bone are consistent with a CSF leak secondary to trauma.
2. Encephalocele (confidence level: 80%) - The imaging findings could suggest an encephalocele, but the history of trauma and acute presentation favor a post-traumatic etiology.
3. Nasal dermoid cyst with secondary infection or rupture (confidence level: 65%) - Could potentially present with similar imaging findings, but less likely given the acute presentation and positive CSF glucose.
4. Nasal glioma with secondary rupture (confidence level: 60%) - A rare possibility that could present with nasal swelling and fluid, but the presence of CSF leakage is not typical.
5. Meningocele (confidence level: 75%) - A type of encephalocele that contains meninges and CSF without brain tissue, which could present with similar imaging findings, though the history of trauma makes this less likely.

The confidence levels are adjusted based on the imaging findings and clinical history, with a post-traumatic CSF leak being the most likely diagnosis. Further clinical evaluation, including possible beta-2 transferrin testing of the nasal discharge and additional imaging, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to plan appropriate management.",95,Insufficient
2014,Neonatal Endophthalmitis,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 1-month-old premature girl of 30 weeks gestation with a left cataract being evaluated for suspected retinoblastoma, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08112014, here are five differential diagnoses:

1. Neonatal encephalitis (confidence level: 85%) - The symmetric restricted diffusion could suggest an infectious or inflammatory process affecting the brain.
2. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) (confidence level: 75%) - A post-infectious inflammatory demyelinating condition that can present with similar imaging findings.
3. Neonatal hypoglycemia (confidence level: 70%) - Can cause white matter injury, particularly in the parietal lobes, but typically would not cause T1 shortening.
4. Mitochondrial disorder (e.g., Leigh syndrome) (confidence level: 65%) - Can present with bilateral symmetric lesions in the basal ganglia and white matter, though less common.
5. Inborn errors of metabolism (confidence level: 60%) - Certain metabolic disorders can present with white matter changes and seizures in the neonatal period.

The confidence levels are adjusted based on the imaging findings that suggest a diffuse process involving the white matter, with neonatal encephalitis being a strong consideration due to the presence of fever and seizures. Further clinical correlation, laboratory tests, and possibly metabolic studies would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other potential causes.",85,Insufficient
2014,Neurofibromatosis Type 2,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04212014, the case involves a 17-year-old boy with epistaxis. Without specific imaging findings or additional clinical information, I can offer a list of five general differential diagnoses for a young patient presenting with epistaxis:

Confidence Level: 70% (This confidence level reflects the broad nature of the differentials without specific imaging details.)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12182014/tab-legends), which describes a high T2 signal intensity lesion in the right corona radiata and internal capsule with no significant mass effect, perilesional edema, or diffusion restriction, faint peripheral enhancement on contrast-enhanced T1WI, and MR spectroscopy showing reduced Cho, NAA peaks, and presence of a lipid-lactate peak, along with positive staining for JC virus on immunohistochemistry, the differential diagnosis can be revised:

1. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) - Given the positive JC virus staining, this is the most likely diagnosis.
2. HIV encephalitis - Less likely given the specific JC virus staining, but still a consideration in an HIV-positive patient.
3. CNS lymphoma - Typically would show more pronounced mass effect and enhancement.
4. Other opportunistic infections - Less likely given the JC virus staining but could include conditions like toxoplasmosis or cytomegalovirus (CMV) encephalitis.
5. Ischemic demyelination - Less likely given the imaging characteristics and JC virus staining.

Confidence Level: 95% (The specific imaging findings and positive JC virus staining strongly suggest PML, which is consistent with the patient's history of immunocompromise due to HIV.)",95,Excellent
2014,Pseudo-Subarachnoid Hemorrhage,"Based on the clinical history of intensive care and status post-resuscitation, as provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10162014, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE)
2. Diffuse cerebral edema
3. Subarachnoid hemorrhage
4. Meningitis
5. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis

Confidence Level: 80%

After reviewing the imaging description provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10162014/tab-legends, which describes diffuse cerebral hypodensity, loss of gray-white matter differentiation, effacement of sulci, and increased attenuation within the subarachnoid spaces and the cisterns on axial noncontrast CT scans, the differential diagnoses would be revised as follows:

1. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) - The diffuse nature of the findings and the history of resuscitation are highly suggestive of HIE.
2. Global cerebral edema - This can occur following resuscitation and severe brain injury.
3. Subarachnoid hemorrhage - Increased attenuation in the subarachnoid spaces could indicate blood, although the diffuse hypodensity is less typical.
4. Meningitis - Can cause increased attenuation in the subarachnoid spaces, but the diffuse cerebral changes are less common.
5. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis - Can lead to diffuse cerebral edema and venous infarcts, but typically has a more focal presentation.

Confidence Level: 90%

The imaging findings of diffuse cerebral hypodensity, loss of gray-white matter differentiation, and effacement of sulci, along with the clinical history of intensive care and post-resuscitation status, strongly suggest Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) as the most likely diagnosis. The specific diagnosis would depend on the integration of these imaging findings with the patient's clinical history, laboratory results, and potentially further imaging to assess for other contributing factors.",90,Good
2014,Pterygoid Hamulus Syndrome,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 63-year-old man with a 7-month history of pain in the lateral soft palate bilaterally, which kept him awake at night, and the palpation findings of bilateral prominent pterygoid hamuli with keratinization of the overlying mucosa, as described in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06192014, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Pterygoid hamulus syndrome
2. Minor salivary gland neoplasm
3. Benign bony growths (e.g., exostoses, tori)
4. Osteoma
5. Palatal or maxillary osteitis

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the imaging description provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06192014/tab-legends, which describes hook-shaped projections from the pterygoid processes bilaterally on CT scans, the differential diagnoses would be revised as follows:

1. Pterygoid hamulus syndrome - The hook-shaped projections on imaging and clinical symptoms are consistent with this diagnosis.
2. Eagle syndrome - Elongation of the styloid process or calcified stylohyoid ligament can cause similar symptoms, but the pterygoid hamuli are the focus here.
3. Osteoma - Benign bone tumors that could present as bony projections, though less likely to be bilateral and symptomatic in this manner.
4. Exostoses/Tori - Benign bony growths that can occur in various locations, including the palate, but typically do not present as hook-shaped projections from the pterygoid processes.
5. Palatal or maxillary osteitis - Inflammation of the bone could potentially cause bony changes, but the imaging findings suggest a more structural anomaly.

Confidence Level: 85%

The presence of bilateral hook-shaped projections from the pterygoid processes and the patient's symptoms of pain in the lateral soft palate suggest Pterygoid hamulus syndrome as the most likely diagnosis. The specific diagnosis would depend on the integration of these imaging findings with the patient's clinical history and physical examination. Further evaluation, including possible referral to an oral surgeon or otolaryngologist, may be necessary for management.",85,Excellent
2014,Radiation Necrosis with Delayed Cyst Formation,"Based on the clinical history provided from the content at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12222014, a 45-year-old woman with a history of chemotherapy and whole brain radiation for metastatic breast cancer, followed by gamma knife radiosurgery to a left frontotemporal lesion, and who has been followed for dysarthria and right-sided simple partial seizures, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Radiation Necrosis
2. Recurrent Metastatic Disease
3. Post-surgical Changes
4. Secondary Glioma
5. Infectious or Inflammatory Process (e.g., abscess, encephalitis)

Confidence Level: 80%

After reviewing the imaging description provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12222014/tab-legends, which describes an enhancing lesion in the left frontotemporal region consistent with metastasis in 2003, and post-gamma knife radiosurgery changes in 2004 with the development of cysts, heterogeneous but diminishing enhancement, and surrounding edema, the differential diagnoses would be revised as follows:

1. Radiation Necrosis - The changes in the lesion's appearance after radiosurgery, including cyst formation and diminishing enhancement, are suggestive of this condition.
2. Recurrent Metastatic Disease - Despite treatment, there is always a possibility of recurrence, especially with heterogeneous enhancement.
3. Treatment-Related Changes - Including post-radiosurgery effects and post-surgical gliosis.
4. Secondary Glioma - Radiation can induce secondary tumors, although this is less common.
5. Infectious or Inflammatory Process - Less likely given the history and imaging findings, but should be considered if clinical symptoms suggest infection.

Confidence Level: 90%

The presence of a previously treated metastatic lesion with subsequent changes after radiosurgery, including cyst formation and variable enhancement, suggests radiation necrosis as the most likely diagnosis. The specific diagnosis would depend on the integration of these imaging findings with the patient's clinical history, including the timeline of treatments and the evolution of symptoms. Further evaluation, including follow-up imaging and potentially advanced imaging techniques or biopsy, may be necessary to differentiate between recurrent disease and treatment-related changes.",90,Excellent
2014,Rathke Cleft Cyst,"Based on the incidental finding of a sellar-suprasellar lesion in a 69-year-old man, as described in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05152014, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Pituitary Macroadenoma
2. Craniopharyngioma
3. Rathke's Cleft Cyst
4. Meningioma
5. Hypothalamic Glioma

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the imaging description provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05152014/tab-legends, which describes a rounded abnormal signal intensity lesion appearing hyperintense on T1-weighted images (T1WI) and hypointense on T2-weighted images (T2WI) within the posterior aspect of the suprasellar lesion, and noting that the lesion has moved more anteriorly in a follow-up study, the differential diagnoses would be revised as follows:

1. Rathke's Cleft Cyst - The T1 hyperintensity and T2 hypointensity could be consistent with the proteinaceous or hemorrhagic content of a Rathke's cleft cyst.
2. Craniopharyngioma - These can also present with mixed signal intensities due to cystic and solid components, and calcifications.
3. Pituitary Macroadenoma with Hemorrhage - Hemorrhage within a macroadenoma can appear hyperintense on T1WI.
4. Arachnoid Cyst - Typically, arachnoid cysts are isointense to CSF on all sequences, but atypical appearances can occur.
5. Dermoid/Epidermoid Cyst - These can have variable signal intensities and may change position due to their contents.

Confidence Level: 85%

The imaging characteristics of the lesion, particularly the hyperintensity on T1WI and hypointensity on T2WI, along with the change in position on follow-up imaging, suggest a lesion with mobile contents, such as a Rathke's cleft cyst or a dermoid/epidermoid cyst. The specific diagnosis would depend on further clinical correlation, including endocrine function tests, and potentially additional imaging modalities or surgical evaluation to confirm the pathology.",85,Excellent
2014,Rosai-Dorfman Disease,"Based on the clinical history of a 37-year-old woman with prior posterior fossa tumor resection presenting with a headache, as provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04172014, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Recurrent Posterior Fossa Tumor
2. Meningioma
3. Metastatic Disease
4. Arachnoid Cyst
5. Postoperative Scar Tissue or Granulation Tissue

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the imaging description provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04172014/tab-legends, which describes enhancing extra-axial masses in the posterior fossa and craniocervical region with a suboccipital craniectomy suggestive of prior surgery, and the masses appearing predominantly hypointense on T2-weighted images (T2WI), isointense on T1-weighted images (T1WI), and demonstrating moderate-intense enhancement following contrast administration, the differential diagnoses would be revised as follows:

1. Recurrent Posterior Fossa Tumor - The enhancement pattern and location suggest a possible recurrence.
2. Meningioma - These tumors are extra-axial and can enhance moderately following contrast.
3. Metastatic Disease - Given the history of a primary tumor, metastases should be considered.
4. Drop Metastases - Tumor cells can spread along CSF pathways, particularly in the setting of prior posterior fossa tumors.
5. Pseudomeningocele - Postoperative changes can sometimes mimic recurrent disease, although the enhancement pattern is less typical.

Confidence Level: 85%

The presence of enhancing extra-axial masses in the posterior fossa and craniocervical region, especially in a patient with a history of posterior fossa tumor resection, raises the suspicion of recurrent disease or metastatic spread. The specific diagnosis would depend on further clinical correlation, including the type of the original tumor, the patient's overall oncologic history, and potentially additional imaging modalities or biopsy to confirm the pathology.",85,Insufficient
2014,Ruptured Isolated PICA Dissecting Aneurysm,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 53-year-old man with a past history of hypertension, presenting with acute onset of severe headache, neck pain, and vomiting, as described in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06052014, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)
2. Cervical Artery Dissection
3. Intracranial Aneurysm
4. Meningitis
5. Hypertensive Encephalopathy

Confidence Level: 80%

After reviewing the imaging description provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06052014/tab-legends, which describes a noncontrast CT showing subarachnoid hemorrhage centered in the cisterna magna of the posterior fossa with an extra-axial filling defect within the clot, and imaging revealing a multilobulated aneurysm of the left Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (PICA), the differential diagnoses would be revised as follows:

1. Ruptured PICA Aneurysm - The imaging findings of subarachnoid hemorrhage and a multilobulated aneurysm of the left PICA are highly suggestive of a ruptured aneurysm.
2. Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM) - These can rupture and cause SAH, but the imaging findings point more towards an aneurysm.
3. Cervical Artery Dissection - Can lead to SAH, but the presence of an aneurysm makes this less likely.
4. Intracranial Hypertension - Can cause headaches and vomiting, but would not explain the SAH or aneurysm.
5. Meningitis - Can present with headache and neck pain, but the imaging findings of SAH and an aneurysm are not consistent with meningitis.

Confidence Level: 95%

The presence of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the cisterna magna, along with the identification of a multilobulated aneurysm of the left PICA on imaging, strongly suggests a ruptured PICA aneurysm as the cause of the patient's acute presentation. The specific diagnosis would depend on the integration of these imaging findings with the patient's clinical history, and the subsequent successful coil embolization of the aneurysm confirms the source of hemorrhage.",95,Excellent
2014,(Secondary) Hemochromatosis,"Based on the clinical history of a 27-year-old woman with amenorrhea and a history of thalassemia, as provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02242014, here are five initial differential diagnoses for the imaging findings:

1. Pituitary Hemorrhage (e.g., Pituitary Apoplexy)
2. Iron Deposition related to Thalassemia (Hemosiderosis)
3. Rathke's Cleft Cyst with Hemorrhage
4. Pituitary Adenoma with Hemorrhagic or Necrotic Changes
5. Hypophysitis (Inflammation of the Pituitary Gland)

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the imaging description provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02242014/tab-legends, which describes susceptibility involving the pituitary gland on coronal T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and susceptibility involving the choroid plexus bilaterally on axial T2WI, the differential diagnoses would be revised as follows:

1. Iron Deposition related to Thalassemia (Hemosiderosis) - The susceptibility on T2WI in the pituitary and choroid plexus is consistent with iron deposition, which is common in patients with thalassemia due to repeated blood transfusions or increased intestinal iron absorption.
2. Pituitary Hemorrhage - Could present with susceptibility, but the bilateral choroid plexus involvement is more suggestive of systemic iron deposition.
3. Rathke's Cleft Cyst with Hemorrhage - While these can have hemorrhagic components, the systemic involvement of the choroid plexus points away from this diagnosis.
4. Hypophysitis - Inflammation can cause changes in the pituitary, but would not typically cause bilateral choroid plexus susceptibility.
5. Secondary Hemochromatosis - Excess iron deposition in tissues due to other causes, but thalassemia is the more likely source in this patient.

Confidence Level: 90%

The presence of T2-weighted imaging susceptibility in both the pituitary gland and the choroid plexus bilaterally is highly suggestive of systemic iron deposition, which is a known complication in patients with thalassemia, particularly those who have received multiple blood transfusions or have increased intestinal iron absorption. The specific diagnosis would depend on the integration of these imaging findings with the patient's clinical history, including transfusion history and iron levels.",90,Excellent

Here are five broad differential diagnoses for these clinical features:

1. Cerebral palsy
2. Metabolic disorder (e.g., leukodystrophy)
3. Genetic syndrome with CNS involvement (e.g., Rett syndrome)
4. Structural brain anomaly (e.g., malformation of cortical development)
5. Post-infectious or post-inflammatory encephalopathy

Confidence Level: 60% (This confidence level reflects the broad nature of the differentials without specific imaging details.)

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided in the second link (https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03032014/tab-legends), which describes fusion of the ventral neocortex and white matter, absence of the anterior interhemispheric fissure, fusion of the caudate nuclei ventral to the fused thalami, a partially present posterior interhemispheric fissure, and absent genu and anterior body of the corpus callosum, the differential diagnosis can be revised:

1. Holoprosencephaly - The imaging findings are consistent with a failure of the prosencephalon to properly divide into the double lobes of the cerebral hemispheres.
2. Septo-optic dysplasia - Typically presents with optic nerve hypoplasia and absence of septum pellucidum, but can have associated midline defects.
3. Lissencephaly - Characterized by ""smooth brain"" appearance due to abnormal neuronal migration, but may not fully explain the midline fusion.
4. Schizencephaly - An abnormal cleft in the cerebral hemispheres, which can sometimes be associated with other midline anomalies.
5. Agenesis of the corpus callosum - While this is noted in the imaging, the presence of other midline fusion abnormalities suggests a more complex malformation.

Confidence Level: 90% (The specific imaging findings strongly suggest a diagnosis of holoprosencephaly, which is a congenital brain malformation resulting from incomplete separation of the right and left hemispheres.)",90,Excellent
2014,Solitary Extrapleural Fibrous Tumor,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 38-year-old man with a slowly growing left nasal mass and no history of epistaxis or signs of infection, as described in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01272014, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Inverted Papilloma

5. Encephalocele

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the imaging description provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01272014/tab-legends, which describes a mildly expansile soft-tissue mass occupying the left nasal fossa without calcification, bone erosion, or sclerosis, and demonstrates a heterogeneous appearance on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) with mild mucosal thickening of the turbinates and obstructive left maxillary and ethmoid sinusitis, as well as heterogeneous enhancement of the mass on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) pre- and post-contrast, the differential diagnoses would be revised as follows:

1. Inverted Papilloma - Given the expansile nature of the mass and heterogeneous enhancement.
2. Juvenile Nasal Angiofibroma - Typically occurs in younger males but can present with similar imaging features.
3. Nasal Polyp - Usually less expansile and with homogeneous enhancement, but still a consideration.
4. Squamous Cell Carcinoma - The absence of bone erosion makes this less likely, but it cannot be ruled out.
5. Fungal Sinusitis - Can present with expansile masses and heterogeneous signal, especially in the setting of sinusitis.

Confidence Level: 85%

The imaging characteristics of the mass, particularly the lack of bone erosion and the heterogeneous enhancement pattern, suggest a benign or low-grade malignant process such as an inverted papilloma.

5. Sphenoid Sinus Mucocele

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the imaging description provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08212014/tab-legends, which describes bone remodeling of the lateral wall of the left sphenoid sinus and the floor of the middle cranial fossa, with obliteration of the pterygoid recess of the sphenoid sinus, thinning and possible erosion of the lateral wall of the sphenoid sinus, and herniation of meninges and brain tissue into the sphenoid sinus, the differential diagnoses would be revised as follows:

1. Sphenoid Sinus Mucocele - The obliteration of the sphenoid sinus and bone remodeling could be due to a mucocele.
2. Meningoencephalocele - Herniation of meninges and brain tissue into the sphenoid sinus suggests this condition.
3. Sphenoid Wing Meningioma - Could cause bone remodeling and neuralgia due to compression of the V2 nerve.
4. Fibrous Dysplasia - Can cause bone thickening and remodeling, but less likely to cause herniation of brain tissue.
5. Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma - Can invade the sphenoid sinus and cause bone changes, but the herniation of meninges and brain tissue is more suggestive of a meningoencephalocele.

Confidence Level: 90%

The presence of bone remodeling and herniation of meninges and brain tissue into the sphenoid sinus is highly suggestive of a meningoencephalocele. The obliteration of the sphenoid sinus and the symptoms of neuralgia in the V2 distribution support this diagnosis.

5. Multiple Sclerosis

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the imaging description provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12042014/tab-legends, which describes a T2-hyperintense ventral spinal cord lesion extending from C5 to C7 with progressive swelling and an increase in the extent of the spinal cord lesion, now involving the whole cross-sectional area of the cord, and spontaneous hyperintensity within the lesion on sagittal T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) without enhancement after gadolinium injection, the differential diagnoses would be revised as follows:

1. Spinal Cord Infarction - The sudden onset of symptoms and the location of the lesion are suggestive of an anterior spinal artery infarction.
2. Transverse Myelitis - Can present with a rapidly progressive spinal cord lesion, although typically there is some degree of enhancement.
3. Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) - Can present with longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions, but enhancement is often present.
4. Spinal Cord Hemorrhage - The spontaneous hyperintensity on T1WI could suggest subacute hemorrhage, but the lack of enhancement is atypical.
5. Acute Flaccid Myelitis - A rare but serious condition that can cause rapid onset of paralysis and spinal cord changes.

Confidence Level: 85%

The imaging findings of a T2-hyperintense lesion without enhancement and the clinical presentation of sudden-onset paraparesis and sensory deficits are most suggestive of a spinal cord infarction, particularly involving the territory of the anterior spinal artery.

After reviewing the additional imaging description provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12082014/tab-legends, which describes an intraspinal, extradural, heterogeneous lesion in the dorsal extradural compartment of the thoracic spine that is hyperintense on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted imaging and suppresses on fat-saturated T1-weighted imaging with avid heterogeneous enhancement, the differential diagnoses would be revised as follows:

1. Spinal Epidural Lipomatosis - The fat saturation suppression and location are consistent with this diagnosis.
2. Epidural Hematoma - Typically does not suppress on fat-saturated imaging, making this less likely.
3. Spinal Epidural Abscess - Could present with enhancement, but the fat saturation suppression suggests a lipid-rich lesion.
4. Spinal Metastasis - Some metastases can be lipid-rich, but the suppression on fat-saturated imaging would be unusual.
5. Spinal Angiolipoma - A benign tumor composed of adipose tissue and abnormal blood vessels, which could explain the imaging characteristics.

Confidence Level: 90%

The imaging characteristics of the lesion, particularly the hyperintensity on T1 and T2 sequences with suppression on fat-saturated imaging and heterogeneous enhancement, suggest a lesion with a significant fat component, such as Spinal Epidural Lipomatosis or Spinal Angiolipoma.

After reviewing the additional imaging description provided in the content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12112014/tab-legends, which describes bilateral, exophytic, highly vascular scalp masses without infiltration of the adjacent calvarium, the differential diagnoses would be revised as follows:

1. Cutaneous Hemangiomas - The description of highly vascular masses is consistent with hemangiomas.
2. Angiosarcoma - A malignant tumor of endothelial origin that can present as a highly vascular mass.
3. Neurofibromatosis Type 1 - Patients may develop plexiform neurofibromas, which can be exophytic and vascular.
4. Lymphatic Malformations - These can present as exophytic masses, though they are not typically described as highly vascular.
5. Kaposi Sarcoma - Associated with immunocompromised states and can present as vascular lesions on the skin.

Confidence Level: 85%

The presence of bilateral, exophytic, highly vascular masses without bone infiltration suggests a vascular origin, such as hemangiomas or angiosarcoma.

1. Subacute Combined Degeneration (SCD) of the Spinal Cord - The symmetric increased signal in the dorsal columns is highly suggestive of SCD, which is associated with vitamin B12 deficiency, often seen in megaloblastic anemia.
2. Copper Deficiency Myelopathy - Can present with similar imaging findings to SCD but is less common.
3. Nitrous Oxide Abuse - Can cause a myelopathy similar to SCD due to interference with vitamin B12 metabolism.
4. HIV Myelopathy - Typically presents with more diffuse spinal cord involvement.
5. Tabes Dorsalis (Neurosyphilis) - Can cause dorsal column abnormalities, but the clinical history of megaloblastic anemia points more towards a nutritional deficiency.

Confidence Level: 95%

The imaging findings of symmetric increased signal intensity along the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, in conjunction with the patient's clinical history of megaloblastic anemia, strongly suggest Subacute Combined Degeneration (SCD) of the spinal cord due to vitamin B12 deficiency.

1. Bilateral orbital fat prolapse - This is suggested by the herniation of intraconal fat.
2. Bilateral orbital fractures with herniation of orbital contents - However, the absence of trauma history or other signs of fracture makes this less likely.
3. Spontaneous orbital fat herniation - This can occur with age-related changes in orbital septum integrity.
4. Bilateral dermoid/epidermoid cysts - These can sometimes appear similar but would not typically show fat herniation.
5. Bilateral lacrimal gland prolapse - This condition can present with bilateral periorbital masses but would not show fat herniation on imaging.

1. Tension Pneumocephalus - The ""Mount Fuji"" sign is indicative of this condition, which can occur after neurosurgical procedures.
2. Postoperative Hematoma - While this can cause mass effect, the presence of air rather than blood makes tension pneumocephalus more likely.
3. Postoperative Infection - Such as meningitis or abscess, but the presence of air is more specific for pneumocephalus.
4. Cerebral Edema - Can occur postoperatively, but would not explain the presence of extra-axial air.
5. Delayed Postoperative Seizure - Can lead to altered mental status, but would not account for the imaging findings of air.

Confidence Level: 95%

The presence of bilateral extra-axial air causing significant compression of the frontal lobes and the ""Mount Fuji"" sign on imaging, especially in the context of recent brain biopsy and craniotomy, strongly suggest Tension Pneumocephalus. This is a neurosurgical emergency that requires prompt recognition and treatment.

1. Acute infarcts in multiple vascular territories - suggested by the reduced diffusion in bilateral thalami and insular cortices.
2. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy - due to global hypoperfusion or hypoxia.
3. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) - a prion disease that can show bilateral thalamic and cortical involvement.
4. Central nervous system infections - such as herpes encephalitis or other viral encephalitides, which can have a predilection for the insular cortex and cingulate gyrus.
5. Metabolic encephalopathy - including Wernicke's encephalopathy, which can affect the thalami.

Confidence Level: 80%

The presence of bilateral thalamic and cortical involvement with restricted diffusion is more suggestive of an acute or subacute process, such as infarction or encephalitis, rather than a postoperative delirium or hepatic encephalopathy. The imaging findings are not typical for metastatic disease or intracranial hemorrhage. It is crucial to correlate these imaging findings with the patient's clinical status, laboratory results, and potentially further imaging or cerebrospinal fluid analysis to reach a definitive diagnosis.",80,Insufficient
2013,Agenesis of the Internal Carotid Artery,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 66-year-old man with left-sided weakness and chest pain, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology (AJNR) at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10282013, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Ischemic stroke - possibly due to carotid artery disease or embolism.
2. Transient ischemic attack (TIA) - given the symptoms of weakness which may be transient.
3. Myocardial infarction (MI) - considering the presence of chest pain, which could be related to cardiac issues.
4. Peripheral neuropathy - which could cause unilateral weakness.
5. Intracranial hemorrhage - as a differential for acute neurological deficits.

Confidence Level: 60%

After reviewing the diagram description from the additional content provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10282013/tab-legends, which mentions an absent right petrous internal carotid artery (ICA) flow void on axial FLAIR, an absent right petrous ICA on CT angiogram source image, and filling of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) via the right posterior communicating artery and the right anterior cerebral artery (ACA) via the anterior communicating artery, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Chronic right ICA occlusion - suggested by the absence of the right petrous ICA and compensatory collateral circulation.
2. Acute ischemic stroke - secondary to chronic ICA occlusion with possible acute thromboembolic event.
3. Aortic dissection - considering the chest pain and potential for associated vascular abnormalities.
4. Collateral circulation due to Moyamoya disease - a possibility given the compensatory flow patterns.
5. Fibromuscular dysplasia or other vasculopathy - which could lead to stenosis or occlusion of the ICA.

Confidence Level: 85%

The imaging findings of an absent right ICA and the presence of collateral circulation are highly suggestive of a chronic vascular occlusion, with the patient's symptoms potentially indicating an acute event superimposed on this chronic condition. The absence of the ICA flow void is a significant finding that narrows the differential diagnosis considerably. It is important to correlate these imaging findings with the patient's clinical history, physical examination, and further diagnostic tests to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate management.",85,Good
2013,Anterior Spinal Artery Syndrome,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 40-year-old woman with sudden and rapid onset of flaccid tetraplegia, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology (AJNR) at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06172013, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP), also known as Guillain-Barr_ syndrome - characterized by rapid onset of muscle weakness.
2. Spinal cord infarction - due to the sudden onset, which may suggest a vascular event.
3. Transverse myelitis - an inflammatory process affecting the spinal cord.
4. Acute flaccid myelitis - a polio-like illness that can cause sudden onset of flaccid paralysis.
5. Severe electrolyte imbalance or neuromuscular disorder - which can present with acute tetraplegia.

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the diagram description from the additional content provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06172013/tab-legends, which mentions a sagittal T2-weighted image (T2WI) demonstrating a long segment of abnormal hyperintense signal involving almost the entire cervical cord with preferential involvement of the anterior aspect of the cord, axial T2WI showing predominant involvement of the central gray matter, and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) demonstrating increased signal involving the ventral gray matter (likened to the ""owl eyes"" appearance), the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Spinal cord infarction - particularly anterior spinal artery syndrome, given the anterior and central gray matter involvement.
2. Acute transverse myelitis - considering the extensive longitudinal involvement.
3. Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) - which can present with longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions.
4. Acute flaccid myelitis - given the ""owl eyes"" appearance and acute flaccid paralysis.
5. Infectious myelitis - such as from herpesvirus or enterovirus, which can cause gray matter involvement.

Confidence Level: 85%

The imaging findings of long segment involvement of the cervical cord with preferential anterior and central gray matter involvement are more suggestive of a spinal cord infarction or an inflammatory process such as transverse myelitis or neuromyelitis optica. The ""owl eyes"" appearance on DWI is a distinctive finding that can be seen in spinal cord infarction. It is important to correlate these imaging findings with the patient's clinical history, laboratory results, and potentially further imaging or cerebrospinal fluid analysis to reach a definitive diagnosis.",85,Excellent
2013,Benign Lymphoepithelial Cysts,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 41-year-old man with fluctuating bilateral neck swelling for the last 10 years, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology (AJNR) at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04222013, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Bilateral parotid gland sialadenosis - non-inflammatory, often related to systemic diseases or nutritional disorders.
2. Sj_gren's syndrome - an autoimmune disease that can cause chronic sialadenitis and gland enlargement.
3. Bilateral parotid cysts - which may present as fluctuating swellings.
4. Benign lymphoepithelial lesions - associated with HIV or other conditions leading to benign lymphoid hyperplasia.
5. Parotid gland tumors - such as Warthin's tumor or pleomorphic adenoma, which can present as bilateral swellings.

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the diagram description from the additional content provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04222013/tab-legends, which mentions axial CT scans of the neck without and with contrast demonstrating relatively well-defined cystic appearing lesions involving both parotid glands without obvious enhancing mass lesion or mural nodule and mild prominence of the nasopharyngeal soft tissue, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Bilateral parotid cysts - supported by the CT findings of well-defined cystic lesions.
2. Sj_gren's syndrome - which can lead to cystic changes in the parotid glands.
3. Benign lymphoepithelial lesions - which can present with cystic changes in the context of HIV or other conditions.
4. Bilateral Warthin's tumors - these often have a cystic appearance and can occur bilaterally.
5. Chronic sialadenitis - which can lead to ductal dilation and cyst formation.

Confidence Level: 85%

The imaging findings of well-defined cystic lesions in both parotid glands without enhancing mass lesions or mural nodules are suggestive of benign processes such as cysts or benign lymphoepithelial lesions. The absence of solid enhancing components makes malignant tumors less likely. The presence of bilateral involvement and the long-standing history of fluctuating neck swelling also support a benign or inflammatory process. It is important to correlate these imaging findings with the patient's clinical history, physical examination, and potentially further diagnostic tests such as sialography, biopsy, or serological studies to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate management.",85,Excellent
2013,Brain Abscess (Caused by Prototheca),"Based on the provided content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology (AJNR) at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05132013, which describes a case involving a 19-year-old man with headache and left upper extremity paresis, and the imaging findings of ring-enhancing, centrally necrotic lesions in the right frontal lobe with hypointense rings on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), no diffusion restriction on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) imaging, and interval improvement after treatment with amphotericin, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Fungal brain abscess - suggested by the ring-enhancing lesions and response to amphotericin.
2. Cerebral toxoplasmosis - especially in immunocompromised patients, presenting with ring-enhancing lesions.
3. Tuberculoma - which can present with ring-enhancing lesions and central necrosis.
4. Neurocysticercosis - a parasitic infection that can cause cystic brain lesions with ring enhancement.
5. Primary CNS lymphoma - which can sometimes present with ring-enhancing lesions, although less likely given the response to antifungal treatment.

Confidence Level: 85%

After reviewing the diagram description from the additional content provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05132013/tab-legends, which includes histopathology demonstrating Prototheca, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Protothecal infection - supported by the histopathology findings and response to amphotericin.
2. Fungal brain abscess - given the ring-enhancing lesions and response to antifungal treatment.
3. Cerebral toxoplasmosis - especially in immunocompromised patients, presenting with ring-enhancing lesions.
4. Tuberculoma - which can present with ring-enhancing lesions and central necrosis.
5. Neurocysticercosis - a parasitic infection that can cause cystic brain lesions with ring enhancement.

2. Thyroglossal duct cyst - although these are typically not hyperdense, they can present with midline neck swelling.
3. Dermoid cyst - less likely given the hyperdensity on CT, but still a consideration for a midline mass.
4. Teratoma - a type of germ cell tumor that can contain various tissue types and present as a midline neck mass.
5. Lymph node metastasis - less likely in the absence of a known primary malignancy, but can present as an enhancing neck mass.

Confidence Level: 90%

The imaging findings of a hyperdense enhancing mass in the midline neck, along with the absence of the thyroid gland in its expected location, strongly suggest ectopic thyroid tissue. This condition occurs when the thyroid gland does not descend normally during embryonic development. The presence of the mass inferior to the hyoid bone is a typical location for ectopic thyroid tissue. It is important to correlate these imaging findings with clinical examination, thyroid function tests, and potentially further diagnostic tests such as scintigraphy to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate management.",90,Excellent

After reviewing the diagram description from the additional content provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11252013/tab-legends, which includes imaging findings of prominent pial vessels on sagittal T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), increased signal within the cord suggestive of edema possibly secondary to venous congestion, hypointense signal in the peripheral aspect of the cord, prominent epidural venous plexus on axial T2WI, and selective angiography showing early opacification of the epidural plexus and perimedullary vein reflux, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (SDAVF) - suggested by the prominent pial vessels, venous congestion, and angiographic findings.
2. Spinal cord neoplasm - such as an ependymoma or hemangioblastoma, which can have associated vascular changes.
3. Spinal cord infarction - which can present with edema and signal changes, though less likely given the vascular findings.
4. Spinal arteriovenous malformation (AVM) - which can present with similar imaging findings but typically has a more defined nidus.
5. Spinal epidural abscess - which can cause cord compression and edema, though the vascular findings would be atypical.

Confidence Level: 95%

The imaging findings of prominent pial vessels, venous congestion, and reflux into perimedullary veins on angiography are highly suggestive of a spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (SDAVF). SDAVF is a vascular malformation that results in abnormal connections between dural arteries and the spinal venous plexus, leading to venous hypertension and subsequent myelopathy. It is important to correlate these imaging findings with the patient's clinical history and potentially further diagnostic tests such as spinal angiography to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate management.",95,Excellent
2013,Facial Calcinosis in Lupus Erythematosus,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 44-year-old woman with recurrent painful infection of the left cheek and extrusion of ""cheesy""-appearing material, along with a long-standing history of facial discoid lupus, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Cutaneous calcinosis - which can occur in the context of connective tissue diseases such as lupus and present with calcified nodules that may extrude material.
2. Sialolithiasis (salivary gland stones) - which can cause recurrent infections and may lead to the extrusion of calcified material.
3. Dermal or subcutaneous infection with secondary calcification - such as from chronic osteomyelitis or skin infections that can calcify over time.
4. Pilomatricoma (calcifying epithelioma of Malherbe) - a benign skin tumor that can calcify and present with extrusion of material.
5. Foreign body reaction - which can cause calcification and recurrent infections if the foreign material is not well tolerated by the body.

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the diagram description from the additional content provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08052013/tab-legends, which includes imaging findings of an area of calcification in the left face adjacent to the ramus of the mandible on plain film, and clusters of calcifications within the soft tissue of the cheeks bilaterally (left greater than right) on coronal and axial CT images displayed in bone algorithm, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Cutaneous calcinosis - supported by the presence of soft tissue calcifications and the history of discoid lupus.
2. Tumoral calcinosis - a condition characterized by large calcified masses, often in a periarticular distribution.
3. Sialadenitis with sialolithiasis - which can lead to calcification within the salivary glands and ducts.
4. Pilomatricoma - considering the calcifications and the possibility of extrusion of material.
5. Chronic infectious process - such as actinomycosis or other chronic granulomatous infections that can lead to calcification.

Confidence Level: 85%

The imaging findings of bilateral soft tissue calcifications, with a greater extent on the left side, and the clinical history of recurrent infections and extrusion of material are suggestive of a chronic process such as cutaneous calcinosis, particularly in the context of a systemic autoimmune disease like lupus. Tumoral calcinosis and sialadenitis with sialolithiasis are also considerations given the location and imaging characteristics. It is important to correlate these imaging findings with the patient's clinical history, physical examination, and potentially further diagnostic tests such as laboratory studies or biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate management.",85,Excellent
2013,Focal Adhesive Arachnoiditis,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 42-year-old man with gradually worsening bilateral leg pain and weakness over the last 12 months and a history of treatment for L3 and L4 vertebral fractures with internal fixation, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology (AJNR) at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06102013, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) - persistent pain following spinal surgery, which may be due to a variety of factors including recurrent disc herniation, postoperative scar tissue (epidural fibrosis), or residual spinal stenosis.
2. Spinal hardware failure - such as a broken screw, which can lead to instability and pain.
3. Spinal stenosis - which can cause leg pain and weakness due to nerve root compression.
4. Epidural abscess or hematoma - which can present with progressive neurological symptoms and may be related to prior surgery.
5. Arachnoiditis - inflammation of the arachnoid layer of the meninges, which can cause clumping of nerve roots and chronic pain.

Confidence Level: 80%

After reviewing the diagram description from the additional content provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06102013/tab-legends, which includes imaging findings of a myelogram AP view and CT myelogram showing evidence of prior surgery with a broken screw, a complete block at the L3 level with a brush-border appearance along the contrast margin suggestive of an extradural obstruction, and axial T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) showing extraneous soft tissue within the spinal canal and a small empty thecal sac with no individual nerve roots seen, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Spinal hardware failure with associated epidural fibrosis or granulation tissue - suggested by the broken screw and evidence of extradural obstruction.
2. Epidural abscess or hematoma - which can cause a complete block and extraneous soft tissue within the spinal canal.
3. Arachnoiditis - the clumping and absence of individual nerve roots may be indicative of this condition.
4. Spinal tumor or metastasis - which can present with extradural obstruction and progressive neurological symptoms.
5. Spinal infection such as discitis or osteomyelitis - which can lead to extradural soft tissue and obstruction.

Confidence Level: 90%

The imaging findings of a broken screw, complete block at the L3 level, and extraneous soft tissue within the spinal canal are highly suggestive of complications related to spinal hardware failure, such as epidural fibrosis or granulation tissue. The absence of individual nerve roots on T2WI could also indicate arachnoiditis. It is important to correlate these imaging findings with the patient's clinical history, physical examination, and potentially further diagnostic tests such as laboratory studies or biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate management.",90,Excellent
2013,Ganglioglioma,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 20-year-old woman with a history of convulsions and the imaging findings described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology (AJNR) at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09022013, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Ganglioglioma - supported by the cortical expansion, calcification/hemorrhage, and history of seizures.
2. Oligodendroglioma - given the calcification and presentation with seizures.
3. Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET) - due to the cortical expansion and association with seizures.
4. Low-grade glioma - which can present with seizures and may have heterogeneous enhancement and calcification.
5. Meningioma - less likely due to the location and cortical expansion but still a consideration due to calcification.

Confidence Level: 90%

The imaging characteristics of cortical expansion, heterogeneous signal intensity with calcification/hemorrhage, and the clinical history of seizures are suggestive of a low-grade, slow-growing cortical tumor such as ganglioglioma, oligodendroglioma, or DNET. These tumors are known to present with seizures and can have calcifications. It is important to correlate these imaging findings with the patient's clinical history, histopathological results from the biopsy, and potentially further diagnostic tests to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate management.",90,Excellent
2013,Hemichorea-Hemiballismus Syndrome in Nonketotic Hyperglycemia,"Based on the provided content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11182013, a 64-year-old man presents with involuntary movements in the right upper and lower extremities. Without specific imaging findings, here are five initial differential diagnoses to consider:

1. Ischemic stroke
2. Hemorrhagic stroke
3. Brain tumor (primary or metastatic)
4. Neurodegenerative disorder (e.g., Huntington's disease or Parkinson's disease)
5. Demyelinating disease (e.g., Multiple Sclerosis)

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11182013/tab-legends, which describe asymmetric hyperdensity in the left putamen on noncontrast CT, increased signal on T1-weighted MRI, no abnormal findings on T2-weighted MRI, no enhancement on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, no diffusion restriction on DWI, and susceptibility on gradient-echo sequence, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Hemorrhagic stroke (specifically intracerebral hemorrhage in the left putamen)
2. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)
3. Calcification or mineralization (e.g., Fahr's disease)
4. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy with petechial hemorrhage
5. Primary or secondary neoplasm with hemorrhagic component

The absence of diffusion restriction makes acute ischemia less likely, and the presence of susceptibility effect with hyperdensity suggests hemosiderin or calcium deposition, which is more consistent with hemorrhage or mineralization. The lack of enhancement and unremarkable T2-weighted image findings argue against an active inflammatory or neoplastic process.

1. Huntington's disease (characterized by caudate atrophy and associated with movement disorders)
2. Wilson's disease (can cause putaminal changes and movement disorders, though typically also has abnormal susceptibility)
3. Neurodegenerative disorder (e.g., Frontotemporal dementia, given the frontal horn enlargement)
4. Toxic/metabolic encephalopathy (could account for bilateral symmetric changes without diffusion restriction)
5. Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) (enlargement of the frontal horns, but typically would not have putaminal atrophy)

The imaging findings of caudate and putaminal atrophy with gliosis are highly suggestive of Huntington's disease, which is consistent with the patient's presentation of abnormal movements and difficulty walking.

2012,Acute Necrotizing Encephalopathy (ANE),"Based on the clinical presentation of a 22-month-old boy with a 2-day history of fever, upper respiratory tract infection, and a decreased level of consciousness, as well as the imaging findings described in the content from https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12242012, here are five initial differential diagnoses to consider:

1. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)
2. Meningoencephalitis (bacterial, viral, or other infectious etiologies)
3. Encephalopathy secondary to infection (e.g., influenza-associated encephalopathy)
4. Acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE)
5. Intracranial hemorrhage (e.g., related to coagulopathy or trauma)

Confidence Level: 80%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12242012/tab-legends, which describe predominant low attenuation lesions involving the thalami bilaterally on axial non-contrast CT scan, hyperintense lesions within both swollen thalami on axial T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), surrounding edema, facilitated diffusion from the central necrotic portion of the lesion on axial diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and restricted diffusion along the margin of the lesion on ADC maps, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) (characterized by bilateral thalamic involvement with edema and necrosis)
2. Influenza-associated encephalopathy (can present with similar imaging findings, especially in pediatric patients)
3. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) (post-infectious inflammatory condition, but typically more widespread white matter involvement)
4. Meningoencephalitis (infectious process, but usually with more diffuse involvement and possible meningeal enhancement)
5. Intracranial hemorrhage with secondary edema (less likely given the pattern of diffusion restriction)

The imaging findings of bilateral thalamic lesions with surrounding edema, central necrosis, and restricted diffusion along the margins are most suggestive of Acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE), a rare but serious condition often associated with viral infections.

3. Multiple sclerosis (MS)
4. Spinal cord infarction
5. Infectious or inflammatory myelopathy (e.g., viral, bacterial, or other autoimmune etiologies)

Confidence Level: 80%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04092012/tab-legends, which describe contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed sagittal (A) and axial (B) T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) demonstrating enhancement of the ventral nerve roots (arrows), the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Lupus myelitis (transverse myelitis associated with SLE, can cause nerve root enhancement)
2. Guillain-Barr_ syndrome (GBS) (typically presents with nerve root enhancement)
3. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) (can show nerve root enhancement)
4. Infectious polyradiculitis (e.g., due to cytomegalovirus in immunocompromised patients)
5. Spinal arachnoiditis (inflammation of the arachnoid layer, can cause nerve root enhancement)

The imaging findings of enhancement of the ventral nerve roots are suggestive of an inflammatory or autoimmune process affecting the spinal nerve roots, which could be related to the patient's underlying SLE or another inflammatory condition such as GBS or CIDP.

Confidence Level: 90%",90,Excellent
2012,Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS),"Based on the clinical presentation of a 43-year-old woman with left-sided weakness and the MRI findings to evaluate for ""multiple sclerosis,"" as described in the content from https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04232012, here are five initial differential diagnoses to consider:

4. Vasculitis (e.g., CNS vasculitis)
5. Infectious or inflammatory processes (e.g., encephalitis, abscess)

Confidence Level: 70%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04232012/tab-legends, which describe increased signal intensity in the region of the precentral gyri (left greater than right) on axial FLAIR and axial T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and increased signal intensity along the corticospinal tracts, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Multiple sclerosis (MS) (characterized by lesions in the white matter, often periventricular, juxtacortical, and infratentorial)
2. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) (post-infectious or post-vaccination inflammatory condition)
3. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) (in the setting of immunosuppression)
4. Ischemic stroke (acute or subacute, particularly if involving the precentral gyrus and corticospinal tract)
5. CNS vasculitis (can cause multifocal lesions with a predilection for certain vascular territories)

The imaging findings of increased signal intensity in the precentral gyri and along the corticospinal tracts are suggestive of a demyelinating process such as multiple sclerosis, especially given the initial consideration for this diagnosis. However, other inflammatory, infectious, or vascular causes should also be considered.

2012,Aneurysmal Bone Cyst of Temporal Bone,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 34-year-old man with dizziness, left facial spasm, and gaze-evoked nystagmus, and the imaging findings from the non-contrast axial CT scans and MRI described in the content from https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02132012, here are five initial differential diagnoses to consider:

1. Cholesteatoma
2. Vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma)
3. Labyrinthitis
4. Hemangioma of the temporal bone
5. Metastatic disease to the petrous temporal bone

Confidence Level: 75%

After reviewing the additional imaging details provided at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02132012/tab-legends, which describe an expansile lytic lesion involving predominantly the left petrous temporal bone and multiple (multiloculated) well-defined rounded-ovoid abnormal signal intensity lesions, likely cystic, with some demonstrating fluid-fluid levels suggestive of intralesional hemorrhage, the differential diagnoses can be revised:

1. Cholesteatoma (expansile lytic lesion with possible cystic components and hemorrhage)
2. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (can present with lytic skull lesions and cystic components)
3. Hemangioma of the temporal bone (can have a lytic appearance and fluid-fluid levels)
4. Brown tumor (hyperparathyroidism-related bone lesion, can have cystic and hemorrhagic components)
5. Metastatic disease (can present with lytic lesions and hemorrhage, though less likely to be multiloculated)

The imaging findings of an expansile lytic lesion with multiloculated cystic components and fluid-fluid levels are most suggestive of a cholesteatoma, which can cause bone erosion and present with hemorrhage, especially given the location in the petrous temporal bone and the patient's symptoms.

Confidence Level: 85%",85,Insufficient
2012,Apical Petrositis,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 7-year-old girl with left otalgia, meningitis, facial pain, and left 6th nerve palsy, as well as the imaging findings described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01232012, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Gradenigo's syndrome - an inflammatory process involving the petrous apex, which can present with otalgia, cranial nerve palsies, and sometimes meningitis.
2. Petrous apex cholesteatoma - a benign growth that can cause bone erosion and present with similar neurological symptoms.
3. Petrous apicitis - infection of the petrous apex, which can lead to cranial nerve involvement and pain.
4. Rhabdomyosarcoma - a type of malignancy that can occur in this region and present with cranial nerve palsies and bone destruction.
5. Langerhans cell histiocytosis - a disease that can involve the skull base and present with bone lesions and cranial nerve deficits.

1. Gradenigo's syndrome - The imaging findings are consistent with inflammation and possible infection, which supports this diagnosis.
2. Petrous apex cholesteatoma - The presence of demineralization and the signal characteristics could be consistent with a cholesteatoma.
3. Petrous apicitis - The imaging findings suggest an infectious or inflammatory process, which is in line with petrous apicitis.
4. Langerhans cell histiocytosis - The bone changes and enhancement pattern could be seen in this condition.
5. Osteomyelitis - The bone demineralization and enhancement may also suggest an infectious process like osteomyelitis of the petrous bone.

Given the imaging characteristics and clinical presentation, I would assign a confidence level of 80% to these revised differential diagnoses. It is important to correlate these findings with the patient's clinical history, laboratory results, and potentially further imaging or biopsy to reach a definitive diagnosis.",80,Excellent
2012,Calcifying Pseudoneoplasm of the Neural Axis (CAPNON),"Based on the limited information provided in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01302012, which mentions a 57-year-old woman with low back pain but does not provide specific imaging findings or clinical details, here are five initial differential diagnoses for low back pain:

1. Lumbar disc herniation - A common cause of low back pain, often associated with radiculopathy.
2. Lumbar spinal stenosis - Narrowing of the spinal canal that can cause back pain and leg symptoms.
3. Degenerative disc disease - Age-related changes in the intervertebral discs that can cause pain.
4. Spondylolisthesis - The forward slippage of one vertebra over another, which can lead to back pain.
5. Musculoskeletal strain - Strain or sprain of the muscles and ligaments in the lumbar region.

After reviewing the diagram description provided in the content from https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01302012/tab-legends, which describes imaging findings of a small focus in the cauda equina at the inferior L2 level with specific signal characteristics and enhancement pattern, as well as histological findings of calcified material with a fibrillar matrix resembling ""chicken feet,"" the differential diagnosis can be revised:

1. Schwannoma - A benign nerve sheath tumor that can present with enhancement and sometimes calcification.
2. Meningioma - Another benign tumor that can arise from the meninges and show calcification and enhancement.
3. Ependymoma - A tumor that can occur in the cauda equina and may present with calcification and faint enhancement.
4. Arachnoid cyst - A cystic lesion that can compress the cauda equina and may show peripheral enhancement.
5. Myxopapillary ependymoma - A specific type of ependymoma that occurs in the cauda equina and can have a mixed signal with enhancement and calcification.

Given the imaging and histological description, I would assign a confidence level of 70% to these revised differential diagnoses. The presence of calcification and the ""chicken feet"" appearance on histology are quite specific and may point towards a particular diagnosis, but without further clinical correlation and possibly additional imaging or laboratory data, it is challenging to reach a definitive diagnosis.",70,Insufficient
2012,Cat Scratch Disease,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 59-year-old man with neck swelling and hoarseness of voice, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07302012, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Laryngeal carcinoma - A common cause of hoarseness and neck swelling, especially in older adults.
2. Thyroid goiter or thyroiditis - Can cause neck swelling and may compress the larynx, leading to hoarseness.
3. Lymphoma - Could present with cervical lymphadenopathy and symptoms due to mass effect.
4. Infectious mononucleosis - Can cause lymphadenopathy and pharyngitis, leading to hoarseness.
5. Tuberculosis (TB) of the larynx - Although less common, TB can cause hoarseness and neck swelling.

After reviewing the diagram description provided in the content from https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07302012/tab-legends, which includes contrast-enhanced axial CT scans showing multiple enlarged cervical lymph nodes, smooth, symmetric thickening of the aryepiglottic folds, and submucosal edema at the level of the true glottis with subsequent resolution on follow-up, the differential diagnosis can be revised:

1. Acute laryngitis - The presence of submucosal edema and symmetric thickening of the aryepiglottic folds could be consistent with an inflammatory process.
2. Laryngeal carcinoma - While this could still be considered, the resolution on follow-up may argue against a malignant process.
3. Angioedema - This could explain the symmetric submucosal swelling and is typically self-limiting.
4. Reactive lymphadenopathy - The lymphadenopathy could be reactive to an infectious or inflammatory process.
5. Autoimmune conditions - Certain autoimmune diseases can cause lymphadenopathy and laryngeal involvement.

Given the imaging findings and the resolution on follow-up, I would assign a confidence level of 75% to these revised differential diagnoses. The resolution of findings suggests a reversible condition rather than a malignant or chronic inflammatory process. However, without additional clinical information or laboratory results, it is difficult to be certain of the diagnosis.",75,Insufficient
2012,Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy-Related Inflammation,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 71-year-old man with subacute progressive behavioral disturbances, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03122012, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Alzheimer's disease - Common in the elderly, can present with behavioral changes.
2. Vascular dementia - Subacute changes in behavior could be related to cerebrovascular disease.
3. Frontotemporal dementia - Can present with progressive behavioral disturbances.
4. Normal pressure hydrocephalus - May manifest with cognitive and behavioral changes.
5. Brain tumor - Depending on the location, could cause progressive behavioral symptoms.

After reviewing the diagram description provided in the content from https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03122012/tab-legends, which includes imaging findings of abnormal signal intensity lesions with associated vasogenic edema in both temporal lobes, subcentimeter foci of susceptibility suggestive of hemorrhage in both cerebral hemispheres, no enhancement on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images, and histopathologic evaluation showing birefringent substance within the vessel walls with immunoreactivity to -amyloid protein, the differential diagnosis can be revised:

1. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) - The presence of hemorrhage and -amyloid immunoreactivity strongly suggests this diagnosis.
2. Alzheimer's disease with CAA - Alzheimer's can coexist with CAA, which could explain the behavioral disturbances and imaging findings.
3. Herpes simplex encephalitis - Can cause temporal lobe edema, but typically would show enhancement and not -amyloid.
4. Primary CNS vasculitis - Can cause multifocal lesions and edema, but the -amyloid immunoreactivity is not typical.
5. Multi-infarct dementia - Vascular changes could lead to behavioral symptoms, but the -amyloid points more towards CAA.

Given the specific imaging and histopathologic findings, I would assign a confidence level of 90% to the revised differential diagnosis, with cerebral amyloid angiopathy being the most likely diagnosis. The presence of -amyloid within the vessel walls is a hallmark of CAA, and the imaging findings are consistent with this condition. However, the final diagnosis should be confirmed with clinical correlation and potentially further testing.",90,Good
2012,Cerebral Hydatidosis,"Based on the clinical presentation of an 8-year-old boy with increasing headache and vomiting, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03192012, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Brain tumor - Primary brain tumors such as astrocytoma or medulloblastoma can present with headache and vomiting due to increased intracranial pressure.
2. Hydrocephalus - Accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid can cause increased intracranial pressure leading to headache and vomiting.
3. Intracranial cyst - Arachnoid cyst or other benign cystic lesions can cause mass effect and symptoms.
4. Intracranial hemorrhage - Subdural or epidural hematoma can present with similar symptoms in the pediatric population.
5. Infectious process - Meningitis or encephalitis can cause headache, vomiting, and other neurological symptoms.

After reviewing the diagram description provided in the content from https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03192012/tab-legends, which includes imaging findings of a large non-enhancing cystic-appearing lesion in the left frontal lobe causing mass effect, shift of the midline structures to the right, and scalloping of the left frontal bone without associated edema, the differential diagnosis can be revised:

1. Arachnoid cyst - The description of a large cystic lesion without enhancement is consistent with an arachnoid cyst.
2. Porencephalic cyst - A post-stroke or post-infectious cavity that communicates with the ventricular system.
3. Low-grade glioma - While these can be cystic, they often have some degree of enhancement.
4. Congenital brain malformation - Such as a schizencephalic cleft, which may present as a cystic lesion.
5. Dermoid/epidermoid cyst - These are benign lesions that can appear cystic and cause mass effect.

Given the imaging characteristics described, I would assign a confidence level of 80% to these revised differential diagnoses. The lack of enhancement and edema, along with the cystic nature and bone scalloping, are more suggestive of a benign cystic lesion such as an arachnoid cyst or a congenital malformation. However, without additional clinical information or further imaging, such as MRI, it is difficult to reach a definitive diagnosis.",80,Insufficient
2012,Cerebral (Venous) Air Embolism,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 78-year-old man who became unresponsive with dilated pupils following the removal of a central venous catheter, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05282012, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Cerebral hypoxia - Due to potential complications from central venous catheter removal, such as air embolism.
2. Stroke - Ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke could cause sudden unresponsiveness and pupil dilation.
3. Intracranial hemorrhage - Subdural, epidural, or intraparenchymal hemorrhage could result from a traumatic catheter removal.
4. Drug overdose or medication effect - Could lead to unresponsiveness and pupil changes.
5. Central nervous system infection - Such as meningitis or encephalitis, which could cause acute neurological changes.

After reviewing the diagram description provided in the content from https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05282012/tab-legends, which includes imaging findings of hypodensity in the left parietal region suggestive of non-hemorrhagic infarction and diffuse hypodensity within cortical sulci on CT scans, as well as extensive venous air embolism within cortical sulci and the superior sagittal sinus on CT venograms, the differential diagnosis can be revised:

1. Cerebral air embolism - The presence of air within the venous system is highly suggestive of an air embolism, which can cause sudden neurological deterioration.
2. Venous infarction - Secondary to venous air embolism leading to cerebral ischemia.
3. Post-surgical complications - Including air embolism or stroke following laparotomy and bowel resection.
4. Cardiac or pulmonary complications - Such as a paradoxical embolism through a patent foramen ovale.
5. Iatrogenic injury - Direct injury to the brain or vasculature during catheter removal.

Given the imaging findings of venous air embolism, I would assign a confidence level of 95% to the revised differential diagnosis, with cerebral air embolism being the most likely diagnosis. The clinical context of recent central venous catheter removal and the imaging findings are highly indicative of this condition. However, the final diagnosis should be confirmed with clinical correlation and consideration of the patient's entire clinical picture, including the perioperative course and any interventions performed.",95,Excellent
2012,Choroid Plexus Papilloma of the 4th Ventricle,"Based on the provided clinical presentation of a 57-year-old man with a 6-week history of headache and ataxia, and the imaging and histopathological findings from the content at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01022012, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Choroid plexus papilloma - The presence of a mixed solid and cystic enhancing mass within the 4th ventricle and histopathological findings of papillary epithelial proliferations on a fibrovascular stroma with atypia and elevated mitotic rate suggest this diagnosis.
2. Choroid plexus carcinoma - The atypia and increased mitotic rate could indicate a more aggressive variant of choroid plexus tumor.
3. Ependymoma - A common tumor in the 4th ventricle that can present with similar imaging features but would have different histopathological characteristics.
4. Medulloblastoma - A malignant brain tumor that occurs in the 4th ventricle, more common in children but can occur in adults, typically showing a different histopathological pattern.
5. Subependymoma - A benign tumor that can occur in the ventricular system, but the histopathological findings of atypia and increased mitotic rate are not characteristic of this tumor.

After reviewing the diagram description provided in the content from https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01022012/tab-legends, which includes contrast-enhanced axial, sagittal, and coronal T1-weighted images showing a large, mixed solid and cystic enhancing mass within the 4th ventricle with minimal associated hydrocephalus, and histopathological evaluation demonstrating a choroid plexus papilloma with atypia and an elevated mitotic rate, the differential diagnosis can be revised to focus on:

1. Choroid plexus papilloma - The imaging and histopathological findings are consistent with this diagnosis.
2. Atypical choroid plexus papilloma - The presence of atypia and increased mitotic activity may suggest a higher grade of choroid plexus papilloma.
3. Choroid plexus carcinoma - While the findings could suggest a more aggressive lesion, the lack of significant hydrocephalus and the described histopathological features are more indicative of a papilloma.

Given the imaging characteristics and histopathological description, I would assign a confidence level of 100% to the diagnosis of choroid plexus papilloma, possibly atypical, due to the presence of atypia and increased mitotic activity. The final diagnosis should be confirmed with a complete histopathological examination and clinical correlation.",100,Excellent
2012,Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP),"Based on the clinical presentation of a 35-year-old woman with bilateral foot drop and recurrent upper extremity paresthesias, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09242012, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Multiple sclerosis (MS) - Can present with paresthesias and motor deficits due to demyelination.
2. Guillain-Barr_ syndrome (GBS) - An acute polyneuropathy that can cause ascending weakness and sensory disturbances.
3. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) - A condition that can cause progressive weakness and sensory loss.
4. Lumbar disc herniation - Could cause foot drop and paresthesias if multiple levels are affected.
5. Peripheral neuropathy - Various etiologies could lead to bilateral foot drop and sensory changes.

After reviewing the diagram description provided in the content from https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09242012/tab-legends, which includes imaging findings of symmetric marked thickening of the extraforaminal cervical nerve roots and diffuse smooth thickening of the cauda equina, as well as grade II anterior listhesis of L5 on S1 with marked spinal canal stenosis, the differential diagnosis can be revised:

1. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) - The symmetric thickening of nerve roots is suggestive of an inflammatory polyneuropathy like CIDP.
2. Neurofibromatosis - Can cause nerve root thickening, but typically presents with other characteristic findings.
3. Spinal dural arteriovenous fistula - Can cause diffuse thickening of the cauda equina due to venous congestion.
4. Leptomeningeal disease - Can cause nerve root thickening due to infiltration by malignancy or infection.
5. Spondylotic myelopathy - The presence of listhesis and spinal canal stenosis could contribute to the symptoms, but may not explain the nerve root thickening.

Given the imaging findings of nerve root and cauda equina thickening, I would assign a confidence level of 85% to the revised differential diagnosis, with CIDP being the most likely diagnosis. The presence of symmetric nerve root thickening is a hallmark of inflammatory polyneuropathies. However, further clinical correlation, laboratory testing, and potentially nerve conduction studies would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",85,Excellent
2012,Cochlear Otosclerosis,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 58-year-old woman with bilateral progressive sensorineural hearing loss and the observation of Schwartze sign during otoscopy, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06182012, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Otosclerosis - A common cause of hearing loss in adults, associated with Schwartze sign.
2. Meniere's disease - Can cause progressive sensorineural hearing loss, typically unilateral but can be bilateral.
3. Vestibular schwannoma (Acoustic neuroma) - Usually presents with unilateral hearing loss, but bilateral cases can occur, especially in neurofibromatosis type 2.

1. Otosclerosis - The lucency around the otic capsule and increased PET uptake are consistent with active otosclerosis.
2. Labyrinthitis ossificans - Can show similar CT findings, but PET uptake is less typical.
3. Superior semicircular canal dehiscence - Can cause hearing loss, but the PET findings would be unusual.
4. Metastatic disease to the otic capsule - Can show increased PET uptake, but would be less likely to present with bilateral findings.
5. Otic capsule dysplasia - A congenital condition that can cause hearing loss, but the PET findings and progressive nature are less typical.

Given the imaging findings of lucency around the otic capsule and increased PET uptake, I would assign a confidence level of 90% to the diagnosis of otosclerosis, particularly considering the clinical presentation and the presence of Schwartze sign. Otosclerosis is a common cause of hearing loss and can show increased metabolic activity on PET imaging.

2012,Diabetic Striatopathy,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 78-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), and transient ischemic attack (TIA) who presents with increasing involuntary movements in the right upper extremity and right face since the last 8 days, and a blood glucose level of 573 mg/dl at admission, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01162012, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Hyperglycemic Hemiballismus - Uncontrolled hyperglycemia can lead to this rare movement disorder.
2. Ischemic stroke - Given her history of TIA and risk factors, a new ischemic event could present with involuntary movements.
3. Hemorrhagic stroke - Could present with hemiballismus or other involuntary movements, especially if involving the basal ganglia.
4. Tardive dyskinesia - A side effect of certain medications that can cause involuntary movements.
5. Parkinson's disease or Parkinsonism - More gradual onset, but can present with asymmetric motor symptoms.

After reviewing the diagram description provided in the content from https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01162012/tab-legends, which includes imaging findings of asymmetric increased density within the left corpus striatum on non-contrast CT, asymmetric increased signal intensity within the left lentiform nucleus on axial T1-weighted MRI, minimal asymmetric loss of signal within the left putamen on axial T2-weighted MRI, and asymmetric increased susceptibility within the left lentiform nucleus on axial gradient-echo MRI, the differential diagnosis can be revised:

1. Hyperglycemic Hemiballismus - The imaging findings are consistent with this condition, which can be associated with T1 hyperintensity and T2 hypointensity due to petechial hemorrhages and deposition of iron and calcium in the setting of hyperglycemia.
2. Non-ketotic hyperglycemic chorea-ballismus - Similar to hyperglycemic hemiballismus, this condition is associated with high blood sugar levels and basal ganglia changes.
3. Ischemic stroke - The imaging findings could be consistent with an acute or subacute infarct, but would typically show different signal characteristics.
4. Hemorrhagic stroke - The gradient-echo findings suggest hemorrhage, but the clinical presentation is more consistent with hyperglycemia-induced hemichorea.
5. Basal ganglia calcification - Could present with similar imaging findings, but less likely to cause acute symptoms.

Given the imaging findings and the clinical context of poorly controlled diabetes, I would assign a confidence level of 95% to the diagnosis of hyperglycemic hemiballismus or non-ketotic hyperglycemic chorea-ballismus. These conditions are known to cause characteristic imaging changes in the basal ganglia and can present with acute hemichorea or hemiballismus in the context of severe hyperglycemia. The final diagnosis should be confirmed with clinical correlation and the resolution of symptoms with the control of blood glucose levels.",95,Excellent
2012,Diastematomyelia with Intramedullary Dermoid,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 10-year-old girl with quadriparesis and scoliosis, as well as the imaging findings described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08132012, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Congenital scoliosis due to vertebral segmentation anomalies - These can be associated with other congenital anomalies and may lead to quadriparesis if there is spinal cord involvement.
2. Spinal dysraphism - A spectrum of congenital spinal anomalies that can include tethered cord, diastematomyelia (split spinal cord), and associated vertebral anomalies.
3. Neurofibromatosis Type I (NF1) - Can present with scoliosis and spinal cord anomalies due to neurofibromas or dural ectasia.
4. Chiari malformation - Can be associated with scoliosis and may cause quadriparesis due to compression of the spinal cord or associated syringomyelia.
5. Tumor - A spinal cord tumor such as an astrocytoma or ependymoma could cause scoliosis and quadriparesis.

After reviewing the diagram description provided in the content from https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08132012/tab-legends, which includes imaging findings of multiple vertebral segmentation anomalies, two hemicords (diastematomyelia), a linear hyperintense signal dividing the spinal canal (likely representing a fibrous or bony septum), and a heterogeneous lesion expanding the thoracic spinal canal, the differential diagnosis can be revised:

1. Diastematomyelia - The presence of two hemicords is indicative of this condition.
2. Tethered cord syndrome - May be associated with diastematomyelia and can cause quadriparesis.
3. Spinal cord lipoma - The heterogeneous lesion could represent a lipoma, often associated with spinal dysraphism.
4. Myelomeningocele - Part of the spectrum of spinal dysraphism that can present with a heterogeneous lesion and vertebral anomalies.
5. Neurenteric cyst - These are rare congenital lesions that can be associated with vertebral anomalies and may present as a heterogeneous lesion.

Given the imaging findings of vertebral segmentation anomalies, two hemicords, and a heterogeneous lesion in the thoracic spinal canal, I would assign a confidence level of 95% to the revised differential diagnosis, with diastematomyelia and associated spinal dysraphism being the most likely diagnosis. The presence of a fibrous or bony septum dividing the spinal canal is characteristic of diastematomyelia. The heterogeneous lesion could represent an associated lipoma or other dysraphic lesion. The final diagnosis should be confirmed with clinical correlation and potentially further imaging or surgical exploration.",95,Excellent
2012,Direct Carotid Cavernous Fistula,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 56-year-old woman with redness and proptosis of the left eye for 5-6 months, as described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02272012, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Orbital cellulitis - An infection of the tissues surrounding the eye, which can cause redness, swelling, and proptosis.
2. Thyroid eye disease (Graves' ophthalmopathy) - An autoimmune condition associated with hyperthyroidism that can lead to inflammation and proptosis.
3. Orbital pseudotumor (Idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome) - A non-specific inflammatory condition that can cause painful eye swelling and proptosis.
4. Orbital tumor - Such as a lymphoma or lacrimal gland tumor, which can present with progressive proptosis.
5. Carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF) - An abnormal connection between the carotid arterial system and the cavernous sinus that can lead to venous congestion and proptosis.

After reviewing the diagram description provided in the content from https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02272012/tab-legends, which includes imaging findings of a prominent left superior ophthalmic vein, stranding of the retrobulbar fat of the left orbit, and saccular outpouching of the left internal carotid artery in the region of the left cavernous sinus, the differential diagnosis can be revised:

1. Carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF) - The prominent left superior ophthalmic vein and saccular outpouching of the left internal carotid artery are highly suggestive of a CCF.
2. Cavernous sinus thrombosis - Can cause venous congestion and proptosis, but the saccular outpouching points more towards a CCF.
3. Orbital tumor with secondary vascular changes - A tumor could cause secondary dilation of the ophthalmic vein, but the saccular outpouching is more specific for a vascular lesion.
4. Dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) - An abnormal connection between arteries and veins within the dura that can lead to similar findings.
5. Orbital varix - A vascular malformation that can cause intermittent proptosis, but less likely to cause the observed saccular outpouching.

Given the imaging findings described, I would assign a confidence level of 95% to the diagnosis of a carotid-cavernous fistula. The combination of a prominent superior ophthalmic vein and the saccular outpouching of the internal carotid artery is characteristic of a CCF. However, further diagnostic workup, including a formal angiogram, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to plan appropriate treatment.",95,Excellent
2012,Disseminated Cysticercosis,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 7-year-old boy with fever, worsening irritability, seizures, proptosis, and hepatosplenomegaly, as well as the imaging findings described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05142012, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Infectious process - Such as bacterial or fungal abscesses, which can present with fever, seizures, and multiple lesions.
2. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) - Can cause bone lesions, proptosis, and systemic symptoms like fever and hepatosplenomegaly.
3. Leukemia/lymphoma - Hematologic malignancies can present with systemic symptoms and CNS involvement.
4. Metastatic disease - Rare in this age group but can present with multiple lesions and systemic symptoms.
5. Rhabdomyosarcoma - A type of soft tissue tumor that can involve the orbits and present with proptosis.

After reviewing the diagram description provided in the content from https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05142012/tab-legends, which includes imaging findings of numerous cystic appearing lesions scattered within the intracranial compartment, both orbits (predominantly involving the extra-ocular muscles), and within visualized muscles of the neck without surrounding edema, the differential diagnosis can be revised:

1. Cysticercosis - The presence of multiple cystic lesions, especially involving the muscles, is highly suggestive of this parasitic infection.
2. Echinococcosis (Hydatid disease) - Another parasitic infection that can cause cystic lesions in various organs.
3. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) - Still a consideration due to the multisystem involvement and proptosis.
4. Neuroblastoma with metastases - Can present with multiple lesions and systemic symptoms, though typically solid rather than cystic.
5. Orbital and intracranial pseudotumor - An inflammatory condition that can cause multiple lesions, but the cystic nature is less typical.

Given the imaging findings of numerous cystic lesions in multiple compartments, I would assign a confidence level of 85% to the diagnosis of a parasitic infection, with cysticercosis being the most likely given the distribution and appearance of the lesions. However, the final diagnosis should be confirmed with clinical correlation, serological testing, and potentially biopsy of the lesions.",85,Excellent
2012,Dysembryoplastic Neuroepithelial Tumor (DNET),"Based on the clinical presentation of a 9-year-old girl with intractable partial-complex seizures and the imaging findings from the content at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09032012, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Low-grade glioma - Such as a pilocytic astrocytoma, which can present with seizures and typically appears as a well-defined lesion with a cystic component.
2. Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET) - A benign brain tumor often associated with seizures in children and young adults, which can have a bubbly appearance on imaging.
3. Ganglioglioma - A rare tumor that can present with seizures and may have a cystic appearance.
4. Arachnoid cyst - A benign cyst that can cause seizures if it exerts mass effect on adjacent brain tissue.
5. Focal cortical dysplasia - A malformation of cortical development that can be associated with epilepsy and may have subtle imaging findings.

After reviewing the diagram description provided in the content from https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09032012/tab-legends, which includes imaging findings of a well-defined, bubbly (lobulated), non-enhancing lesion appearing hypointense on T1-weighted images (T1WI) and hyperintense on T2-weighted images (T2WI) in the right medial frontal lobe, with MR spectroscopy showing a mildly elevated choline peak, a reduced N-acetylaspartate (NAA) peak, and a lactate-lipid peak, and MR-DSC perfusion study not demonstrating any increased relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), the differential diagnosis can be revised:

1. Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET) - The bubbly appearance and non-enhancing nature on MRI are characteristic of DNET, which is often associated with seizures.
2. Low-grade glioma - The MR spectroscopy findings could be consistent with a low-grade glioma, but the lack of enhancement and increased rCBV is less typical.
3. Ganglioglioma - The lesion's appearance could fit a ganglioglioma, but these tumors often enhance and may show increased rCBV.
4. Arachnoid cyst - The imaging characteristics are not typical for an arachnoid cyst, which usually does not show a lactate-lipid peak on MR spectroscopy.
5. Focal cortical dysplasia - The well-defined and lobulated nature of the lesion is not typical for focal cortical dysplasia.

Given the imaging characteristics and the clinical presentation, I would assign a confidence level of 90% to the diagnosis of a Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET). The lack of enhancement and increased rCBV, along with the MR spectroscopy findings, support this diagnosis. However, the final diagnosis should be confirmed with histopathological examination following biopsy or resection.",90,Excellent
2012,Dystrophic Calcification of Secondary Hyperparathyroidism,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 31-year-old woman with a headache and a known history of end-stage renal disease secondary to WHO class IV lupus nephritis, as well as lab evaluation consistent with secondary hyperparathyroidism, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Metastatic calcification - Secondary to chronic renal failure and secondary hyperparathyroidism, which can lead to widespread vascular and soft tissue calcifications.
2. Fahr's syndrome - A rare, genetic, or sporadic disorder characterized by bilateral calcifications in the basal ganglia and other brain regions.
3. Intracranial hemorrhage - Chronic or remote hemorrhages can lead to calcifications, but would be less likely to be as extensive as described.
4. Infectious or inflammatory conditions - Such as CNS infections (e.g., TORCH infections) or inflammatory diseases (e.g., sarcoidosis) that can cause calcifications.
5. Mitochondrial disorders - Some mitochondrial diseases can lead to basal ganglia calcifications.

After reviewing the diagram description provided in the content from https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04302012-c1/tab-legends, which includes axial CT scans demonstrating extensive calcification involving the basal ganglia, thalami, the periventricular white matter, and the cerebellum, the differential diagnosis can be revised:

1. Metastatic calcification - The extensive calcification pattern is highly suggestive of this condition, especially given the patient's history of end-stage renal disease and secondary hyperparathyroidism.
2. Fahr's syndrome - While Fahr's syndrome could present with similar imaging findings, the patient's history of renal disease and secondary hyperparathyroidism makes metastatic calcification more likely.
3. Calciphylaxis - A condition associated with renal disease that can lead to vascular calcification, but typically affects the skin and subcutaneous tissues.
4. Hypoparathyroidism - Can lead to intracranial calcifications, but the patient's elevated parathyroid hormone level makes this less likely.
5. Carbon monoxide poisoning - Can lead to bilateral globus pallidus calcifications, but the extensive nature of calcifications in this case is not typical.

Given the imaging findings and the patient's medical history, I would assign a confidence level of 95% to the diagnosis of metastatic calcification due to secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with chronic renal failure. The extensive nature of the calcifications and the patient's known endocrine condition strongly support this diagnosis. However, further clinical correlation and potentially additional imaging or laboratory tests would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other potential causes.",95,Excellent
2012,Endolymphatic Sac Tumor (ELST),"Based on the clinical presentation of a 20-year-old man with left-sided hearing loss and vertigo, and the imaging findings described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07232012, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Vestibular schwannoma (Acoustic neuroma) - A benign tumor of the vestibulocochlear nerve that can present with hearing loss and vertigo.
2. Meniere's disease - An inner ear disorder that can cause vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus.
3. Cholesteatoma - An abnormal growth of skin in the middle ear that can erode bone and affect hearing.
4. Labyrinthitis - Inflammation of the inner ear that can lead to hearing loss and vertigo.
5. Otosclerosis - A bone remodeling disorder of the otic capsule that can cause conductive or sensorineural hearing loss.

After reviewing the diagram description provided in the content from https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07232012/tab-legends, which includes a non-contrast axial CT scan demonstrating a destructive lesion in the left vestibular aqueduct with irregular margins, and axial CISS and contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed axial T1-weighted MRI demonstrating an enhancing heterogeneous mass, the differential diagnosis can be revised:

1. Vestibular schwannoma (Acoustic neuroma) - The presence of an enhancing mass in the region of the vestibular aqueduct is highly suggestive of this diagnosis.
2. Endolymphatic sac tumor - A rare, locally aggressive tumor that can arise from the endolymphatic sac and cause bone destruction and hearing loss.
3. Labyrinthitis ossificans - A condition following inflammation where the labyrinth becomes ossified, but typically does not present as an enhancing mass.
4. Metastatic lesion - A possibility given the enhancing nature of the mass, though less common in this age group without known primary cancer.
5. Paraganglioma (Glomus tumor) - These vascular tumors can occur in the temporal bone and may present with similar imaging findings.

Given the imaging findings of a destructive lesion with an enhancing mass, I would assign a confidence level of 85% to the diagnosis of a vestibular schwannoma or an endolymphatic sac tumor, with a higher likelihood for the former given the patient's age and presenting symptoms. However, the final diagnosis should be confirmed with further clinical evaluation, possibly including audiometric testing and biopsy.",85,Excellent
2012,Erosive Arachnoiditis,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 76-year-old man with back pain and cauda equina syndrome, as well as the imaging findings described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03262012, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Lumbar spinal stenosis - Can cause back pain and cauda equina syndrome due to narrowing of the spinal canal.
2. Degenerative disc disease - May lead to back pain and nerve root compression.
3. Metastatic spinal disease - Can present with back pain and neurological deficits due to compression of the cauda equina.
4. Infectious spondylodiscitis - Infection of the intervertebral discs and adjacent vertebrae can cause back pain and neurological compromise.
5. Spinal epidural abscess - An abscess in the epidural space can compress the cauda equina and lead to back pain and neurological symptoms.

After reviewing the diagram description provided in the content from https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/03262012/tab-legends, which includes imaging findings of fusion of multiple vertebrae and straightening of the spine consistent with ankylosing spondylitis, as well as clumping/peripheral distribution of the nerve roots, an empty appearance of the thecal sac, and arachnoid diverticulae with erosions of the posterior elements, the differential diagnosis can be revised:

1. Ankylosing spondylitis - The fusion of multiple vertebrae and straightening of the spine are characteristic of this inflammatory condition.
2. Cauda equina syndrome secondary to ankylosing spondylitis - The clumping of nerve roots and arachnoid diverticulae may be complications of longstanding ankylosing spondylitis.
3. Arachnoiditis - The clumping of nerve roots and empty thecal sac appearance suggest arachnoiditis, which can be associated with ankylosing spondylitis.
4. Spinal dural ectasia - The presence of arachnoid diverticulae and erosions of the posterior elements could be indicative of dural ectasia, which is associated with ankylosing spondylitis.
5. Spinal tumor or metastasis - While the imaging findings are more suggestive of an inflammatory process, a tumor could theoretically cause similar symptoms.

Given the imaging findings and the clinical context, I would assign a confidence level of 95% to the diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis with secondary cauda equina syndrome. The presence of vertebral fusion, straightening of the spine, and the specific pattern of nerve root clumping are highly indicative of this diagnosis. However, the final diagnosis should be confirmed with clinical correlation and potentially further testing, such as laboratory markers of inflammation and a detailed patient history.",95,Excellent
2012,Extradural Spinal Arachnoid Cyst,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 76-year-old man with back pain and cauda equina syndrome, and the imaging findings described in the content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04022012, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Spinal epidural abscess - Can present with back pain and cauda equina syndrome due to compression of the spinal cord or nerve roots.
2. Spinal meningioma - A benign tumor that can cause similar symptoms through compression.
3. Spinal schwannoma - Another benign tumor that arises from nerve sheath cells and can compress the spinal cord or nerve roots.
4. Spinal metastasis - Secondary tumors from a primary cancer elsewhere in the body can cause extradural lesions and neurological symptoms.
5. Spinal arachnoid cyst - A cystic lesion that can cause compression of the spinal cord or nerve roots, leading to pain and neurological deficits.

After reviewing the diagram description provided in the content from https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04022012/tab-legends, which includes imaging findings of an ovoid, predominantly cystic appearing lesion in the mid-thoracic spine with signal intensity characteristics paralleling that of CSF in the posterior extradural compartment, and no enhancement after contrast administration, the differential diagnosis can be revised:

1. Spinal arachnoid cyst - The imaging characteristics of the lesion being cystic and paralleling CSF signal intensity are highly suggestive of an arachnoid cyst.
2. Spinal epidural cyst - Similar to an arachnoid cyst, but typically located within the epidural space.
3. Spinal meningioma - While meningiomas can be extradural, they usually enhance after contrast administration, making this less likely.
4. Spinal schwannoma - Typically shows enhancement after contrast, so the lack of enhancement makes this less likely.
5. Spinal metastasis - The lack of enhancement and the cystic nature of the lesion make metastasis less likely.

Given the imaging findings of a cystic lesion with CSF-like signal intensity and no post-contrast enhancement, I would assign a confidence level of 90% to the diagnosis of a spinal arachnoid cyst. The location and imaging characteristics are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the final diagnosis should be confirmed with clinical correlation and potentially further imaging or surgical exploration.",90,Excellent
2012,(Giant) Hemangiopericytoma,"Based on the clinical presentation of a 55-year-old man with a right sub-occipital scalp mass, chronic headache, right-sided facial weakness, right-sided hearing loss, dysphagia, change in voice, and imbalance for one year, and the imaging findings from the content at https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11122012-0, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Metastatic disease - The presence of a skull base mass with associated symptoms could be due to metastasis from a primary cancer elsewhere in the body.
2. Schwannoma - These benign tumors can arise from cranial nerves and may present with a mass and neurological deficits.
3. Meningioma - A common benign intracranial tumor that can cause mass effect and symptoms due to compression of adjacent structures.
4. Chordoma - A malignant bone tumor that can occur at the skull base and present with a destructive mass.
5. Paraganglioma (Glomus tumor) - These tumors can be highly vascular and may present with a mass and cranial nerve involvement.

After reviewing the diagram description provided in the content from https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11122012-0/tab-legends, which includes imaging findings of a lytic right occipital lesion with surrounding soft tissue swelling, prominent flow-voids within the lesion on T2-weighted images (T2WI), strands of hyperintensity likely reflective of intratumoral hemorrhage, right tongue hemiatrophy suggestive of hypoglossal nerve involvement, heterogeneously enhancing destructive skull base mass on contrast-enhanced coronal T1-weighted images (T1WI), intensely vascular mass on time-of-flight MR angiography (TOF-MIP), and histopathology demonstrating ""stag horn"" vessels of hemangiopericytoma, the differential diagnosis can be revised:

1. Hemangiopericytoma - The presence of ""stag horn"" vessels on histopathology and the intensely vascular nature of the mass are characteristic of this diagnosis.
2. Paraganglioma (Glomus tumor) - While these tumors are vascular, the specific histopathological finding of ""stag horn"" vessels is more indicative of hemangiopericytoma.
3. Metastatic disease - The heterogeneity and vascularity could suggest metastasis, but the histopathology is more consistent with hemangiopericytoma.
4. Meningioma - Some meningiomas can be vascular, but they typically do not demonstrate the ""stag horn"" vascular pattern.
5. Chordoma - The destructive nature of the mass could suggest chordoma, but the histopathology and vascularity are more consistent with hemangiopericytoma.

Given the imaging and histopathological findings described, I would assign a confidence level of 95% to the diagnosis of hemangiopericytoma. The combination of imaging features and the distinctive histopathological pattern of ""stag horn"" vessels strongly support this diagnosis. However, the final diagnosis should be confirmed with a complete histopathological examination and clinical correlation.",95,Excellent
2012,GM1 Gangliosidosis (Adult-Onset Type),"Based on the provided content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06042012, the case describes a 52-year-old man with a history of Morquio's syndrome, presenting with progressive generalized dystonia, gait and speech disturbances, bilateral hip pain, and paraparesis. Given this clinical context, here are five initial differential diagnoses:

1. Morquio's syndrome progression (confidence level: 90%)
2. Cervical myelopathy (confidence level: 70%)
3. Parkinson's disease or Parkinsonism (confidence level: 60%)
4. Multiple system atrophy (confidence level: 50%)
5. Wilson's disease (confidence level: 40%)

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06042012/tab-legends, which describe axial T2WI and FLAIR images showing increased signal involving the lateral putamina with bilateral basal ganglia atrophy, chest X-ray and X-ray of the abdomen demonstrating scoliosis, and X-ray of the pelvis showing left hip dysplasia, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Morquio's syndrome with neurological manifestations (confidence level: 95%) - The imaging findings and clinical presentation are consistent with the known musculoskeletal and neurological complications of Morquio's syndrome.
2. Secondary dystonia due to basal ganglia atrophy (confidence level: 80%) - The atrophy of the basal ganglia could be contributing to the dystonia and gait disturbances.
3. Neurodegenerative disorder with orthopedic manifestations (confidence level: 65%) - The combination of neurological and orthopedic findings could suggest a neurodegenerative process that also affects the musculoskeletal system.
4. Primary hip pathology with neurological sequelae (confidence level: 55%) - The hip dysplasia and pain could be primary, with neurological symptoms developing as a result of compensatory changes or chronic pain.
5. Spinal pathology with secondary dystonia (confidence level: 50%) - The scoliosis and potential spinal involvement could be causing or exacerbating the neurological symptoms.

The high confidence level for Morquio's syndrome is due to the patient's known history of the condition, which is known to cause both neurological and skeletal abnormalities. The other conditions are considered less likely but are included as differentials due to the complexity of the patient's presentation and the need to consider all possible causes of his symptoms.",95,Insufficient
2012,Guillain-Barr_ Syndrome,"Based on the initial content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06112012, a 10-year-old girl presents with quadriparesis and bilateral absent patellar and Achilles reflexes.

3. Transverse myelitis (confidence level: 70%)
4. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) (confidence level: 65%)
5. Familial dysautonomia (confidence level: 50%)

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06112012/tab-legends, which describe precontrast and postcontrast sagittal T1-weighted MR images showing cauda equina enhancement and axial contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images depicting marked enhancement and thickened anterior spinal nerve roots at the level L1 and in the cauda equina, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Guillain-Barr_ syndrome (confidence level: 90%) - The enhancement of the cauda equina and nerve roots is characteristic of this condition, which can present with ascending paralysis and areflexia.
2. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) (confidence level: 85%) - Similar to Guillain-Barr_ syndrome, CIDP can show nerve root enhancement but typically has a more chronic course.
3. Spinal cord tumor (confidence level: 50%) - While tumors can cause nerve root enhancement, the bilateral and symmetric nature of the findings is less typical for a neoplasm.
4. Infectious or inflammatory causes of myelitis (confidence level: 75%) - Infections or inflammatory processes can cause nerve root and spinal cord enhancement.
5. Leukemia or lymphoma with CNS involvement (confidence level: 55%) - Hematological malignancies can sometimes present with nerve root enhancement, though other systemic symptoms are usually present.

The confidence levels have been adjusted based on the imaging findings, which are more suggestive of an inflammatory or demyelinating process rather than a structural lesion like a tumor. Guillain-Barr_ syndrome and CIDP are at the top of the differential diagnosis list due to the characteristic imaging findings and clinical presentation of quadriparesis and areflexia.",90,Excellent
2012,Hypertrophic Olivary Degeneration (HOD),"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07092012, a 27-year-old woman presents with palatal myoclonus following a head injury 4 months earlier.

5. Neurodegenerative disorder (e.g., Huntington's disease) (confidence level: 40%)

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07092012/tab-legends, which describe multiple foci of susceptibility at the gray-white matter junction and the splenium of the corpus callosum suggestive of diffuse axonal injury, as well as susceptibility in the region of the left midbrain and abnormal signal intensity involving the left medulla in the region of the inferior olivary nucleus, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Post-traumatic brain injury with diffuse axonal injury (confidence level: 95%) - The imaging findings are highly suggestive of diffuse axonal injury, which is consistent with the history of head trauma and can lead to palatal myoclonus.
2. Secondary epilepsy post-trauma (confidence level: 70%) - Traumatic brain injury can lead to the development of epilepsy, which may present with myoclonic features.
3. Brainstem lesion (confidence level: 80%) - The abnormal signal in the left medulla and midbrain could be due to a localized brainstem lesion, which may result from trauma or other etiologies.
4. Central pontine myelinolysis (confidence level: 60%) - Although typically associated with rapid correction of hyponatremia, it can present with similar imaging findings and neurological symptoms.
5. Neuroinflammatory disorder (e.g., multiple sclerosis) (confidence level: 50%) - While less likely given the acute history and imaging findings, neuroinflammatory conditions can sometimes present with similar symptoms and MRI changes.

The confidence levels have been adjusted based on the imaging findings, which strongly suggest a post-traumatic etiology, specifically diffuse axonal injury, as the cause of the patient's palatal myoclonus. The other conditions are considered less likely but are included as differentials due to the need to consider all possible causes of the patient's symptoms.",95,Insufficient
2012,Indirect Dural Arteriovenous Fistula of Left Cavernous Sinus,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10012012, a 59-year-old man presents with left eye pain, decreased vision, history of prostatitis, left eye proptosis, and normal thyroid studies. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for this presentation:

1. Orbital cellulitis (confidence level: 75%)
2. Thyroid eye disease (Graves' ophthalmopathy) (confidence level: 65%) - Despite normal thyroid studies, clinical presentation could still suggest this condition.
3. Orbital tumor (confidence level: 70%)
4. Carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF) (confidence level: 80%) - Given the sudden onset of symptoms after a procedure.
5. Cavernous sinus thrombosis (confidence level: 75%)

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10012012/tab-legends, which describe left eye chemosis and proptosis, mild asymmetric fullness of the left cavernous sinus on non-contrast CT, and asymmetric fullness of the left superior ophthalmic vein on contrast-enhanced CT, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF) (confidence level: 90%) - The asymmetric fullness of the cavernous sinus and superior ophthalmic vein is highly suggestive of CCF, particularly given the sudden onset of symptoms post-procedure.
2. Cavernous sinus thrombosis (confidence level: 85%) - This condition can present with similar imaging findings, but the acute presentation is more consistent with CCF.
3. Orbital cellulitis (confidence level: 60%) - While cellulitis can cause proptosis and eye pain, the imaging findings are less typical for this diagnosis.
4. Orbital tumor (confidence level: 50%) - A tumor could cause proptosis and pain, but the sudden onset of symptoms and specific imaging findings make this less likely.
5. Inflammatory conditions (e.g., Tolosa-Hunt syndrome) (confidence level: 55%) - Inflammatory conditions can cause painful ophthalmoplegia and imaging changes, but the presentation is less acute.

The confidence levels have been adjusted based on the imaging findings, which strongly suggest a vascular etiology, with CCF being the most likely given the clinical and imaging context. The other conditions are considered less likely but are included as differentials due to the complexity of the patient's presentation and the need to consider all possible causes of his symptoms.",90,Good

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11052012/tab-legends, which describe a well-defined heterogeneously enhancing calcified anterior skull base mass extending into the intracranial compartment with mass effect on the frontal lobes, caudally into the nasoethmoidal complex, and laterally causing hypertelorism with possible orbital invasion, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Olfactory groove meningioma (confidence level: 85%) - The location and calcification are suggestive of this diagnosis, along with the mass effect and extension pattern.
2. Esthesioneuroblastoma (confidence level: 80%) - This tumor arises from the olfactory epithelium and can present with similar imaging characteristics and clinical symptoms.
3. Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) (confidence level: 75%) - Although more common in adolescent males, JNA can present with similar findings but typically involves the sphenopalatine foramen and pterygopalatine fossa.
4. Fibrous dysplasia (confidence level: 70%) - This benign bone disorder can cause hypertelorism and mass effect but is less likely to present with the described pattern of aggressive growth.
5. Chordoma (confidence level: 65%) - Chordomas can occur at the skull base and may present with calcifications and intracranial extension, but they are rare in this age group.

The confidence levels have been adjusted based on the imaging findings, which suggest a neoplastic process at the anterior skull base with both intra- and extracranial involvement. The presence of calcification, mass effect, and the specific pattern of extension are critical in narrowing down the differential diagnosis.",85,Excellent
2012,Intraosseous Hemangioma of Skull,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04162012, a 36-year-old woman presents with an incidental skull lesion. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for this presentation:

1. Fibrous dysplasia (confidence level: 80%)
2. Hemangioma (confidence level: 70%)
3. Osteoma (confidence level: 60%)
4. Meningioma with hyperostosis (confidence level: 50%)
5. Metastatic lesion (confidence level: 40%)

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04162012/tab-legends, which describe a CT scan with a large, expansile left frontal intraosseous lesion with a sunburst appearance due to radiating trabeculae in the left parietal bone, with the inner and outer tables intact and no soft tissue component seen, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Fibrous dysplasia (confidence level: 90%) - The ""sunburst"" pattern and expansile nature of the lesion with intact tables are characteristic of fibrous dysplasia.
2. Osteoid osteoma (confidence level: 75%) - This benign bone tumor can present with a radiating pattern but is less likely given the size of the lesion.
3. Hemangioma (confidence level: 70%) - Skull hemangiomas can present as expansile lesions, but they typically have a more honeycomb-like appearance.
4. Osteoblastoma (confidence level: 65%) - Similar to osteoid osteoma but usually larger and can have an expansile ""sunburst"" appearance.
5. Paget's disease (confidence level: 60%) - Paget's disease can cause skull thickening and trabecular changes, but the presentation is less typical for this age group and usually involves more extensive areas of the skull.

The confidence levels have been adjusted based on the imaging findings, which suggest a benign intraosseous lesion with a characteristic ""sunburst"" appearance. Fibrous dysplasia is the most likely diagnosis given these findings, and the absence of a soft tissue component makes a diagnosis of meningioma with hyperostosis or a metastatic lesion less likely.",90,Good
2012,Isolated Hypothalamic Metastasis from Lung Cancer,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08202012, a 51-year-old man with small cell lung cancer presents with an enhancing hypothalamic mass. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for this presentation:

1. Metastasis from small cell lung cancer (confidence level: 90%)
2. Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) (confidence level: 70%)
3. Glioma (e.g., glioblastoma) (confidence level: 65%)
4. Hypothalamic hamartoma (confidence level: 50%)
5. Germinoma (confidence level: 60%)

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08202012/tab-legends, which describe an enhancing hypothalamic mass on sagittal T1-weighted image (A), contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed axial (B), and coronal (C) images with no other enhancing lesions seen, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Metastasis from small cell lung cancer (confidence level: 95%) - Given the patient's history of small cell lung cancer, a solitary enhancing hypothalamic mass is highly suggestive of a metastatic lesion.
2. Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) (confidence level: 75%) - PCNSL can present as an isolated enhancing mass, but the patient's known primary cancer makes this less likely.
3. Glioma (e.g., glioblastoma) (confidence level: 70%) - While gliomas can occur in the hypothalamic region, the patient's cancer history makes metastasis more likely.
4. Germinoma (confidence level: 65%) - Germinomas can present as enhancing masses in the hypothalamus, particularly in younger patients, but the patient's age and cancer history make this less likely.
5. Hypothalamic hamartoma (confidence level: 55%) - These are typically non-enhancing and more common in children, making this diagnosis less likely in this context.

The confidence levels have been adjusted based on the imaging findings and the patient's history of small cell lung cancer, which significantly increases the likelihood of a metastatic lesion. The absence of other enhancing lesions does not exclude metastasis, as solitary metastases can occur. The other conditions are considered less likely but are included as differentials due to the need to consider all possible causes of the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.",90,Excellent
2012,Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma (JA),"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12172012, a 14-year-old boy presents with nasal obstruction and epistaxis.

1. Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) (confidence level: 85%)
2. Inverted papilloma (confidence level: 70%)
3. Rhabdomyosarcoma (confidence level: 65%)
4. Nasal polyps (confidence level: 60%)
5. Sinonasal carcinoma (confidence level: 55%)

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12172012/tab-legends, which describe a moderate-intensely enhancing lobulated mass in the region of the pterygopalatine fossa extending into various adjacent structures and demonstrating classic scalloping and anterior displacement of the posterior wall of the left maxillary sinus with erosion into the pterygoid plates, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) (confidence level: 95%) - The imaging findings of an enhancing lobulated mass with bone erosion and the clinical presentation of nasal obstruction and epistaxis in a male adolescent are highly characteristic of JNA.
2. Inverted papilloma (confidence level: 75%) - This benign tumor can present with similar symptoms and imaging findings but is less common in this age group.
3. Rhabdomyosarcoma (confidence level: 70%) - This is the most common malignant tumor of the nasal cavity in children, but the imaging characteristics are more suggestive of JNA.
4. Sinonasal carcinoma (confidence level: 60%) - Carcinomas can present with aggressive features and bone erosion but are rare in this age group.
5. Lymphoma (confidence level: 65%) - Lymphoma can present as a mass in the nasal cavity, but the pattern of bone erosion and the patient's age make JNA more likely.

The confidence levels have been adjusted based on the imaging findings and the patient's age and gender, which strongly suggest JNA as the most likely diagnosis. The other conditions are considered less likely but are included as differentials due to the need to consider all possible causes of the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.",95,Excellent
2012,Megalencephalic Leukoencephalopathy with Subcortical Cysts (MLC),"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09172012, a 1-year-old boy presents with an enlarging head circumference and developmental delay. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for this presentation:

1. Hydrocephalus (confidence level: 85%)
2. Metabolic disorder (e.g., leukodystrophy) (confidence level: 75%)
3. Brain tumor (e.g., astrocytoma) (confidence level: 65%)
4. Infection (e.g., congenital cytomegalovirus) (confidence level: 70%)
5. Craniosynostosis (confidence level: 60%)

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09172012/tab-legends, which describe axial T2-weighted images (T2WI) showing diffuse swelling and increased signal of the white matter, as well as bilateral anterior temporal lobe cysts of CSF intensity, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Leukodystrophy (confidence level: 90%) - The diffuse white matter swelling and increased signal are characteristic of a leukodystrophy, which is a group of disorders affecting the white matter.
2. Hydrocephalus (confidence level: 80%) - While hydrocephalus can cause an enlarging head circumference, the presence of bilateral temporal lobe cysts and white matter changes may suggest an underlying metabolic or genetic condition.
3. Congenital infection (e.g., congenital cytomegalovirus) (confidence level: 85%) - Congenital infections can lead to white matter damage and cyst formation, but the pattern may not be as diffuse.
4. Glutaric aciduria type I (confidence level: 75%) - This metabolic disorder can present with macrocephaly, frontotemporal atrophy, and white matter changes.
5. Aicardi syndrome (confidence level: 70%) - This is a rare genetic disorder that can present with developmental delay, seizures, and characteristic brain abnormalities, including cysts.

The confidence levels have been adjusted based on the imaging findings, which suggest a primary white matter disorder, with leukodystrophy being the most likely diagnosis given the diffuse white matter swelling and increased signal. The presence of bilateral anterior temporal lobe cysts further supports a diagnosis that affects the white matter, such as a metabolic or genetic condition.",90,Good
2012,Multiple System Atrophy-Parkinson Type (MSA-P),"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07022012, a 47-year-old woman presents with progressive bradykinesia.

3. Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (confidence level: 70%)
4. Wilson's disease (confidence level: 65%)
5. Drug-induced parkinsonism (confidence level: 60%)

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07022012/tab-legends, which describe axial FLAIR (A), axial gradient echo (B), and axial T2WI (C) demonstrating posterior lateral putaminal atrophy, T2-hypointensity, and ""slit-like"" marginal hyperintensity, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Multiple system atrophy, parkinsonian type (MSA-P) (confidence level: 90%) - The imaging findings of putaminal atrophy and ""slit-like"" hyperintensity are characteristic of MSA-P, which can present with bradykinesia similar to Parkinson's disease.
2. Parkinson's disease (confidence level: 80%) - While Parkinson's disease is a common cause of bradykinesia, the specific imaging findings are more suggestive of MSA.
3. Wilson's disease (confidence level: 75%) - Wilson's disease can cause similar symptoms and may show T2-hypointensity due to copper deposition, but the ""slit-like"" hyperintensity is less typical.
4. Carbon monoxide poisoning (confidence level: 70%) - Chronic exposure can lead to parkinsonism and may show T2 changes in the basal ganglia, but the clinical history would need to support this diagnosis.
5. Drug-induced parkinsonism (confidence level: 65%) - Certain drugs can cause parkinsonism, but the imaging findings would not typically show the described putaminal changes.

The confidence levels have been adjusted based on the imaging findings, which are highly suggestive of Multiple System Atrophy, parkinsonian type (MSA-P), given the posterior lateral putaminal atrophy and characteristic ""slit-like"" marginal hyperintensity. The other conditions are considered less likely but are included as differentials due to the need to consider all possible causes of the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.",90,Excellent
2012,Neonatal Candida Albicans Brain Abscesses,"Based on the initial content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10152012, a 10-day-old premature neonate presents with episodes of apnea, bradycardia, and seizures, with a previously normal head sonogram.

2. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) (confidence level: 75%)
3. Neonatal sepsis (confidence level: 70%)
4. Congenital infection (e.g., TORCH infections) (confidence level: 65%)
5. Metabolic disorder (e.g., urea cycle disorder) (confidence level: 60%)

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10152012/tab-legends, which describe coronal and sagittal sonographic images showing numerous hyperechoic areas in the cerebral hemispheres, corpus callosum, and basal ganglia, with corresponding hypointense signal on T1 Inversion Recovery sequence and diffusion restriction on DWI and corresponding ADC maps, and the development of bilateral grade I germinal matrix hemorrhage with evolution into hypoechoic, likely cystic, components, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Neonatal cerebral infarction (confidence level: 85%) - The presence of diffusion restriction and hypointense signal on T1 suggests acute ischemic injury.
2. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) (confidence level: 80%) - The pattern of injury and the clinical presentation are consistent with HIE, which can occur in premature neonates.
3. Congenital infection (e.g., TORCH infections) (confidence level: 75%) - The multifocal nature of the lesions could be consistent with an infectious etiology.
4. Neonatal sepsis with CNS involvement (confidence level: 70%) - Sepsis can lead to multifocal brain lesions and hemorrhage.
5. Metabolic disorder (e.g., urea cycle disorder) (confidence level: 65%) - Metabolic disorders can present with encephalopathy and seizures, but the imaging findings are less specific.

The confidence levels have been adjusted based on the imaging findings, which suggest an acute process with ischemic injury and subsequent hemorrhagic transformation. The presence of diffusion restriction is particularly suggestive of acute ischemic injury, while the evolution into cystic components may indicate a process of encephalomalacia following injury.",85,Insufficient
2012,Neurosyphilis,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07162012, a 46-year-old HIV-negative man presents with a six-month history of personality disturbances, somnolency, and aphasia.

3. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis (confidence level: 75%)
4. Frontotemporal dementia (confidence level: 65%)
5. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) (confidence level: 60%)

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/07162012/tab-legends, which describe asymmetric increased signal abnormality involving the cortical and subcortical white matter of the medial and lateral left temporal lobe on FLAIR images, trace suspicious bright signal involving both temporal lobes (left > right) on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and no enhancement on contrast-enhanced axial T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis (confidence level: 85%) - The involvement of the temporal lobes and the clinical presentation are highly suggestive of HSV encephalitis, despite the lack of enhancement.
2. Limbic encephalitis (confidence level: 80%) - This condition can present with similar imaging findings and clinical symptoms, often associated with paraneoplastic or autoimmune etiologies.
3. Glioma (e.g., low-grade astrocytoma) (confidence level: 70%) - While gliomas can present with similar imaging findings, the lack of enhancement and the clinical presentation make this less likely.
4. Cerebral infarction (confidence level: 65%) - An infarct could present with DWI changes, but the lack of diffusion restriction and the bilateral involvement are less typical.
5. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) (confidence level: 75%) - CJD can present with rapidly progressive dementia and may show DWI changes, but typically has more widespread cortical involvement.

The confidence levels have been adjusted based on the imaging findings, which suggest an inflammatory or infectious process, with HSV encephalitis being the most likely diagnosis given the temporal lobe involvement and clinical presentation. The lack of enhancement and diffusion restriction on ADC maps may be atypical for HSV encephalitis but does not exclude the diagnosis. Limbic encephalitis is also a strong consideration given the imaging and clinical features.",85,Insufficient
2012,Orbital Venous-Lymphatic Malformation (OVLM) (Lymphangiomas),"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10082012, a 3-month-old boy presents with a history of eye deformity.

3. Encephalocele (confidence level: 60%)
4. Retinoblastoma (confidence level: 50%)
5. Orbital dermoid/epidermoid cyst (confidence level: 75%)

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10082012/tab-legends, which describe a multi-septated, non-enhancing cystic appearing mass in the left orbit with a shrunken left globe suggestive of phthisis bulbi, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Congenital orbital cyst (confidence level: 90%) - The multi-septated, cystic nature of the mass and the associated phthisis bulbi are highly suggestive of a congenital cystic lesion.
2. Orbital dermoid/epidermoid cyst (confidence level: 85%) - These benign cystic lesions are common in the pediatric population and can cause deformation of the globe.
3. Teratoma (confidence level: 75%) - Teratomas are rare congenital tumors that can present as complex cystic masses in the orbit.
4. Colobomatous cyst (microphthalmia with cyst) (confidence level: 80%) - This condition can present with a cystic lesion associated with a malformed globe.
5. Persistent fetal vasculature (PFV)/Persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV) (confidence level: 70%) - PFV/PHPV can lead to a shrunken globe and may be associated with cystic changes, although typically not multi-septated.

The confidence levels have been adjusted based on the imaging findings, which suggest a congenital cystic lesion in the orbit with associated phthisis bulbi. The lack of enhancement and the multi-septated appearance of the mass are key features in narrowing down the differential diagnosis.",90,Insufficient
2012,Persistent Hyperplastic Primary Vitreous (PHPV),"Based on the initial content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02202012, a 1-month-old boy presents with leukocoria.

3. Coats disease (confidence level: 75%)
4. Congenital cataract (confidence level: 70%)
5. Retinal detachment (confidence level: 65%)

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02202012/tab-legends, which describe a sagittal T2-weighted image (T2WI) showing a shallow anterior chamber and increased signal intensity likely due to chronic hemorrhage in the subhyaloid space, with a detached structure representing the detached posterior hyaloid membrane not converging to the optic disk, and a hypointense tubular structure suggestive of Cloquet's canal, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Persistent fetal vasculature (PFV)/Persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV) (confidence level: 90%) - The imaging findings of a shallow anterior chamber and the presence of Cloquet's canal are suggestive of PFV/PHPV.
2. Retinoblastoma (confidence level: 75%) - While retinoblastoma can present with leukocoria, the lack of a mass lesion on the provided imaging reduces the likelihood of this diagnosis.
3. Retinal detachment (confidence level: 85%) - The detached posterior hyaloid membrane and chronic hemorrhage are consistent with retinal detachment.
4. Coats disease (confidence level: 70%) - Coats disease can present with leukocoria and retinal detachment, but the specific imaging findings provided are less typical.
5. Vitreous hemorrhage (confidence level: 80%) - Chronic hemorrhage in the subhyaloid space could be due to vitreous hemorrhage, which can present with leukocoria.

The confidence levels have been adjusted based on the imaging findings, which suggest a process involving the vitreous and possibly the retina, with PFV/PHPV being the most likely diagnosis given the specific imaging features described. The other conditions are considered less likely but are included as differentials due to the need to consider all possible causes of leukocoria in a neonate.",90,Excellent
2012,Pseudohypoparathyroidism,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04302012-c2, a 12-year-old girl presents with a history of seizures, short stature, and short metacarpals.

4. Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy (confidence level: 80%)
5. Brain calcifications secondary to infection or inflammation (e.g., congenital toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus) (confidence level: 65%)

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/04302012-c2/tab-legends, which describe calcifications in the basal ganglia and the subcortical white matter on axial CT scan of the brain and faint soft tissue calcification within the subcutaneous tissues of the left ankle on X-ray, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Pseudohypoparathyroidism (confidence level: 90%) - The presence of basal ganglia calcifications, short stature, and short metacarpals are characteristic of this condition, which is associated with resistance to parathyroid hormone.
2. Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy (confidence level: 85%) - This condition can present with similar features to pseudohypoparathyroidism, including brachydactyly and calcifications.
3. Fahr's syndrome (confidence level: 80%) - Fahr's syndrome is characterized by brain calcifications, but it is not typically associated with short stature or short metacarpals.
4. Hypoparathyroidism (confidence level: 75%) - Hypoparathyroidism can lead to brain calcifications and seizures, but the clinical presentation may also suggest a genetic syndrome like pseudohypoparathyroidism.
5. Secondary brain calcifications due to metabolic disorders (e.g., hypothyroidism, mitochondrial disorders) (confidence level: 70%) - Metabolic disorders can cause brain calcifications and growth abnormalities, but the specific pattern of calcifications and skeletal changes may point towards a diagnosis like pseudohypoparathyroidism.

The confidence levels have been adjusted based on the imaging findings and the clinical presentation, which suggest a genetic or metabolic disorder with resistance to parathyroid hormone as the most likely diagnosis. Pseudohypoparathyroidism and Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy are at the top of the differential diagnosis list due to the characteristic combination of clinical and imaging findings.",90,Excellent
2012,Radiation Myelopathy (RM),"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06252012, a 51-year-old man with a history of nasopharyngeal cancer post-radiation therapy presents for evaluation.

3. Osteoradionecrosis (confidence level: 75%)
4. Radiation-induced vertebral compression fracture (confidence level: 70%)
5. Secondary malignancy (e.g., sarcoma) (confidence level: 65%)

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/06252012/tab-legends, which describe sagittal T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) showing increased signal within the vertebral bodies consistent with fatty marrow replacement and sagittal T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) demonstrating increased signal within the cervical cord, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Radiation-induced myelopathy (confidence level: 90%) - The increased signal within the cervical cord on T2WI is suggestive of myelopathy, which can occur as a delayed complication of radiation therapy.
2. Osteoradionecrosis (confidence level: 85%) - The fatty marrow replacement seen on T1WI could be indicative of osteoradionecrosis, a condition that results from compromised blood supply to the bone following radiation therapy.
3. Metastatic disease (confidence level: 75%) - While metastasis could account for vertebral body changes, the lack of aggressive features on imaging makes this less likely.
4. Radiation-induced vertebral compression fracture (confidence level: 80%) - The increased signal within the vertebral bodies may represent edema associated with a compression fracture, which can be a consequence of radiation-induced bone weakening.
5. Secondary malignancy (e.g., sarcoma) (confidence level: 70%) - Secondary malignancies can occur in previously irradiated fields, but the imaging findings would typically be more aggressive.

The confidence levels have been adjusted based on the imaging findings, which suggest a radiation-induced process, with myelopathy being the most likely diagnosis given the increased signal within the cervical cord on T2WI and the patient's history of radiation therapy. The other conditions are considered less likely but are included as differentials due to the need to consider all possible causes of the patient's imaging findings.",90,Excellent
2012,Radiation-Induced Tumefactive Cyst (RITC),"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08062012, a 64-year-old man with a history of sporadic headache and previous gamma knife therapy for a right temporal arteriovenous malformation (AVM) 10 years ago, here are five initial differential diagnoses for the cystic appearing lesion in the right temporal lobe:

3. Brain tumor (e.g., metastasis, glioma) (confidence level: 65%)
4. Arachnoid cyst (confidence level: 60%)
5. Infectious process (e.g., abscess, neurocysticercosis) (confidence level: 55%)

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/08062012/tab-legends, which describe a non-contrast axial CT scan showing a cystic appearing lesion in the right temporal lobe with adjacent faint calcifications, axial T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) and FLAIR demonstrating the lesion to be slightly hyperintense compared to CSF with surrounding vasogenic edema, and contrast-enhanced axial T1WI showing suspicious faint enhancement along the anterior aspect of the lesion, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Radiation necrosis (confidence level: 95%) - The history of gamma knife therapy, cystic appearance, faint calcifications, and surrounding edema are highly suggestive of radiation necrosis.
2. Residual or recurrent AVM (confidence level: 75%) - Given the patient's history, the possibility of residual or recurrent AVM should be considered, although the imaging findings are more consistent with radiation necrosis.
3. High-grade glioma (confidence level: 70%) - High-grade gliomas can present with cystic changes, surrounding edema, and enhancement, but the patient's history of radiation therapy makes radiation necrosis more likely.
4. Brain metastasis (confidence level: 65%) - Metastatic disease can present with similar imaging features, but there is no mention of a known primary malignancy.
5. Inflammatory or infectious process (e.g., abscess) (confidence level: 60%) - While infectious processes can cause cystic lesions with surrounding edema, the faint enhancement and the patient's history suggest a post-radiation change.

The confidence levels have been adjusted based on the imaging findings and the patient's clinical history, with radiation necrosis being the most likely diagnosis given the characteristic imaging features and the history of gamma knife therapy for an AVM. The other conditions are considered less likely but are included as differentials due to the need to consider all possible causes of the patient's imaging findings.",95,Good
2012,Recurrent Cholesteatoma,"Based on the provided content from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11262012, a 55-year-old woman with chronic ear discharge and a history of prior surgery for cholesteatoma, here are five initial differential diagnoses for the soft tissue within the right external auditory canal and tympanic cavity:

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11262012/tab-legends, which describe a reconstructed coronal CT scan showing soft tissue within the right external auditory canal and tympanic cavity, and coronal Turbo Spin Echo DWI and corresponding ADC map demonstrating restricted diffusion of this soft tissue, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Recurrent cholesteatoma (confidence level: 95%) - The history of prior cholesteatoma surgery and the imaging findings of soft tissue with restricted diffusion are highly suggestive of a recurrent cholesteatoma.
2. Post-surgical granulation tissue (confidence level: 80%) - Granulation tissue can form as a post-operative complication and may show restricted diffusion, but it is less likely given the specific imaging characteristics.
3. Squamous cell carcinoma of the external auditory canal (confidence level: 85%) - While carcinoma can present with restricted diffusion, the patient's history of cholesteatoma makes recurrence more likely.
4. Otitis externa (malignant otitis externa) (confidence level: 75%) - This condition can present with soft tissue in the external auditory canal, but the restricted diffusion is more typical of a cholesteatoma or neoplasm.
5. Abscess formation (confidence level: 70%) - An abscess could present with restricted diffusion, but the chronic nature of the patient's symptoms and the history of cholesteatoma make this less likely.

The confidence levels have been adjusted based on the imaging findings and the patient's clinical history, with recurrent cholesteatoma being the most likely diagnosis given the characteristic imaging features and the history of prior cholesteatoma surgery. The presence of restricted diffusion on DWI is particularly suggestive of a recurrent cholesteatoma.",95,Excellent
2012,Sacral Giant Cell Tumor,"Based on the initial content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05072012, a 54-year-old woman presents with slowly progressive pain in the right hemipelvis and radiation into the right leg for two months. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for this presentation:

1. Metastatic disease (confidence level: 80%)
2. Osteomyelitis (confidence level: 75%)
3. Sacral insufficiency fracture (confidence level: 70%)
4. Primary bone tumor (e.g., chondrosarcoma) (confidence level: 65%)
5. Inflammatory arthritis affecting the sacroiliac joint (e.g., ankylosing spondylitis) (confidence level: 60%)

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05072012/tab-legends, which describe a well-defined area of rarefaction involving the right sacrum with a suggestion of cortical disruption, no intrinsic calcification, no surrounding sclerosis, and corresponding abnormal signal intensity on MRI that is hypointense on T1WI, hyperintense on T2WI, and demonstrates contrast enhancement with areas of necrosis within the lesion, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Metastatic disease (confidence level: 85%) - The presence of a well-defined lesion with contrast enhancement and areas of necrosis is highly suggestive of metastasis, especially given the patient's age.
2. Chondrosarcoma (confidence level: 80%) - The imaging characteristics could be consistent with a primary bone tumor such as chondrosarcoma, which can present with a similar pattern of bone destruction and enhancement.
3. Osteomyelitis (confidence level: 75%) - The lack of surrounding sclerosis makes osteomyelitis less likely, but it cannot be completely ruled out given the presence of necrosis.
4. Giant cell tumor (confidence level: 70%) - Giant cell tumors can present with well-defined lytic lesions and enhancement, but they are less common in the sacrum.
5. Lymphoma (confidence level: 65%) - Lymphoma can present with bone lesions that enhance and have necrotic areas, although it is less common in the sacrum.

The confidence levels have been adjusted based on the imaging findings, which suggest a neoplastic process, with metastatic disease being the most likely diagnosis given the patient's age, the lesion's characteristics, and the absence of typical features of infection or inflammatory arthritis. The presence of necrosis within the lesion further supports the likelihood of a malignant process.",85,Good
2012,Skull Base Osteomyelitis (SBO),"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12032012, a 60-year-old man with uncontrolled diabetes presents with a complex clinical picture including left-sided earache and ear discharge, headache, facial deviation, hearing loss, dysphagia, hoarseness of voice, drooping of left shoulder, and multiple cranial nerve palsies. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for this case:

1. Malignant otitis externa with skull base osteomyelitis (confidence level: 90%)
2. Cholesteatoma with complications (confidence level: 80%)
3. Neoplasm, such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma (confidence level: 75%)
4. Skull base metastasis (confidence level: 70%)
5. Granulomatous disease, such as tuberculosis or fungal infection (confidence level: 65%)

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/12032012/tab-legends, which describe focal erosion involving the clivus, diffuse opacification of the mastoid air cells, focal signal abnormality on T2WI involving the dorsal aspect of the clivus, and heterogeneous enhancement involving the clivus with adjacent dural thickening and abnormal enhancement involving the prevertebral musculature, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Malignant otitis externa with skull base osteomyelitis (confidence level: 95%) - The patient's history of uncontrolled diabetes, clinical presentation, and imaging findings of clival erosion and abnormal enhancement are highly suggestive of this diagnosis.
2. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (confidence level: 85%) - Given the location and pattern of enhancement, a primary malignancy such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma should be considered.
3. Skull base metastasis (confidence level: 80%) - Metastatic disease could present with similar imaging findings, but there is no mention of a known primary malignancy.
4. Lymphoma (confidence level: 75%) - Lymphoma can present with dural thickening and enhancement, although it is less common in the clivus.
5. Granulomatous disease (e.g., tuberculosis, fungal infection) (confidence level: 70%) - The patient's immunocompromised state raises the possibility of granulomatous diseases, which can cause skull base lesions and cranial nerve palsies.

The confidence levels have been adjusted based on the imaging findings and the patient's clinical history, with malignant otitis externa with skull base osteomyelitis being the most likely diagnosis given the patient's diabetes, the chronic nature of the symptoms, and the characteristic imaging features. The presence of multiple cranial nerve palsies and the involvement of the clivus and prevertebral musculature are particularly suggestive of this condition.",95,Excellent
2012,Spinal Epidural Angiolipoma,"Based on the initial content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10222012, a 74-year-old woman presents with progressive gait and sphincter disturbance. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for this case:

1. Spinal epidural metastasis (confidence level: 85%)
2. Spinal meningioma (confidence level: 80%)
3. Spinal epidural abscess (confidence level: 75%)
4. Spinal lymphoma (confidence level: 70%)
5. Spinal epidural lipomatosis (confidence level: 65%)

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/10222012/tab-legends, which describe a multisegmental posterior epidural spinal lesion with mass effect on the spinal cord, heterogeneous but predominantly hypodense appearance on CT suggesting a fatty component, and intense heterogeneous enhancement of this fusiform, well-defined epidural mass on contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed sagittal and axial T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) with extension into the paravertebral soft tissues, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Spinal epidural lipomatosis (confidence level: 90%) - The presence of a fatty component within the lesion is highly suggestive of lipomatosis, although the intense enhancement is atypical.
2. Spinal meningioma (confidence level: 85%) - Meningiomas can present as well-defined epidural masses with heterogeneous enhancement, but they typically do not have a fatty component.
3. Spinal epidural metastasis (confidence level: 80%) - Metastatic disease can present with heterogeneous enhancement and extension into paravertebral tissues, but the fatty component would be unusual.
4. Spinal lymphoma (confidence level: 75%) - Lymphoma can present as an enhancing epidural mass, but the presence of a fatty component is not characteristic.
5. Spinal schwannoma (confidence level: 70%) - Schwannomas can extend through neural foramina and show intense enhancement, but they are typically not epidural or fatty.

The confidence levels have been adjusted based on the imaging findings, which suggest a lesion with a fatty component and significant enhancement. The presence of a fatty component within the lesion is most suggestive of spinal epidural lipomatosis, but the intense enhancement and extension into paravertebral tissues may indicate a more complex pathology.",90,Insufficient
2012,St. Louis Encephalitis (SLEV),"Based on the provided case summary from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09102012, a 37-year-old woman presents with fever, drowsiness, tremulousness, and quadriparesis. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for this presentation:

1. Central nervous system (CNS) infection (e.g., encephalitis, meningitis) (confidence level: 85%)
2. Autoimmune or paraneoplastic encephalitis (confidence level: 80%)
3. Multiple sclerosis or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) (confidence level: 75%)
4. Metabolic encephalopathy (e.g., hepatic or uremic encephalopathy) (confidence level: 70%)
5. CNS vasculitis (confidence level: 65%)

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/09102012/tab-legends, which describe increased signal involving the substantia nigra bilaterally on axial T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and coronal FLAIR image, with no evidence of enhancement on contrast-enhanced axial T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Parkinson's disease or parkinsonism syndromes (confidence level: 90%) - Bilateral involvement of the substantia nigra with increased T2 signal is characteristic of Parkinson's disease, although the acute presentation is atypical.
2. Wilson's disease (confidence level: 85%) - Can present with neurological symptoms and bilateral basal ganglia involvement, but typically shows copper deposition.
3. CNS infection affecting the basal ganglia (e.g., viral encephalitis) (confidence level: 80%) - Infections can cause increased T2 signal in the substantia nigra, but the lack of enhancement is less typical.
4. Autoimmune or paraneoplastic encephalitis (confidence level: 75%) - These conditions can affect the basal ganglia and present with acute neurological symptoms, but usually have additional imaging or clinical findings.
5. Carbon monoxide poisoning or hypoxic-ischemic injury (confidence level: 70%) - These can lead to bilateral basal ganglia changes, but the clinical history would need to support exposure or an ischemic event.

The confidence levels have been adjusted based on the imaging findings, which suggest a process affecting the substantia nigra bilaterally without enhancement, making Parkinson's disease or related parkinsonism syndromes a consideration, despite the acute presentation. The lack of enhancement makes infectious or inflammatory processes less likely, although they cannot be completely ruled out.",90,Insufficient
2012,Subdural Hematoma from a Ruptured Pericallosal Artery Aneurysm,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01092012, a 49-year-old man presents with a sudden severe headache. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for this presentation:

1. Ruptured cerebral aneurysm (confidence level: 95%)
2. Subarachnoid hemorrhage of other etiology (e.g., arteriovenous malformation) (confidence level: 85%)
3. Hypertensive intracranial hemorrhage (confidence level: 80%)
4. Subdural hematoma (confidence level: 75%)
5. Cerebral venous thrombosis (confidence level: 70%)

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/01092012/tab-legends, which describe non-contrast CT scans showing subdural hematoma in the anterior interhemispheric region extending over the right cerebral convexity, a suggestion of right superior medial frontal intraparenchymal hematoma with minimal surrounding edema, and conventional DSA and 3D volume-rendered reformat obtained from a right internal carotid injection demonstrating a multilobulated aneurysm arising from the right pericallosal artery, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Ruptured cerebral aneurysm (confidence level: 99%) - The presence of a subdural hematoma, intraparenchymal hematoma, and the identification of a multilobulated aneurysm on DSA strongly suggest a ruptured aneurysm as the cause of the hemorrhage.
2. Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) with hemorrhage (confidence level: 70%) - While an AVM could cause similar hemorrhagic patterns, the identified aneurysm makes this less likely.
3. Traumatic brain injury leading to subdural hematoma (confidence level: 65%) - The clinical history does not suggest trauma, and the imaging findings of an aneurysm point to a vascular cause.
4. Cerebral venous thrombosis with secondary hemorrhage (confidence level: 60%) - This condition can lead to hemorrhage, but the imaging findings of an aneurysm are not consistent with venous thrombosis.
5. Hypertensive intracranial hemorrhage (confidence level: 55%) - Hypertension can cause intraparenchymal hemorrhage, but the presence of an aneurysm and subdural hematoma is more indicative of an aneurysmal rupture.

The confidence levels have been adjusted based on the imaging findings, which provide strong evidence for a ruptured cerebral aneurysm as the cause of the patient's acute presentation. The identification of the aneurysm on angiographic studies is particularly diagnostic in this case.",99,Excellent
2012,Thrombosed Giant Vertebral Artery Aneurysm,"Based on the initial content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02062012, a 58-year-old man presents with progressive quadriparesis, headache, neck pain, and pyramidal symptoms. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for this presentation:

1. Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (confidence level: 85%)
2. Spinal cord tumor (e.g., astrocytoma, ependymoma) (confidence level: 80%)
3. Multiple sclerosis (confidence level: 75%)
4. Spinal cord infarction (confidence level: 70%)
5. Inflammatory or infectious myelitis (e.g., transverse myelitis, tuberculosis) (confidence level: 65%)

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/02062012/tab-legends, which describe a well-defined multilobulated lesion in the cerebellopontine angle cistern causing mass effect and compression of the medulla and pons, with a distinct flow-void anterior and to the right of this lesion, and no pulsation artifact seen, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma) (confidence level: 90%) - The location in the cerebellopontine angle and the presence of a well-defined multilobulated lesion with mass effect are characteristic of a vestibular schwannoma.
2. Meningioma (confidence level: 85%) - Meningiomas can also present as well-defined lesions in the cerebellopontine angle, but the flow-void may suggest a different etiology.
3. Epidermoid cyst (confidence level: 80%) - These benign lesions can occur in the cerebellopontine angle and cause compression of adjacent structures.
4. Arachnoid cyst (confidence level: 75%) - Arachnoid cysts can present in the cerebellopontine angle, but they typically do not enhance or show a flow-void.
5. Paraganglioma (glomus tumor) (confidence level: 70%) - Paragangliomas can present with flow-voids due to their vascularity, but they are less common in this location.

The confidence levels have been adjusted based on the imaging findings, which suggest a lesion in the cerebellopontine angle with mass effect on the brainstem and a flow-void, making vestibular schwannoma the most likely diagnosis. The presence of a flow-void may indicate a highly vascular lesion, which is characteristic of vestibular schwannomas, also known as acoustic neuromas.",90,Insufficient
2012,Transient Global Amnesia,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05212012comp, the case involves an 84-year-old man with transient amnesia. Unfortunately, the specific imaging findings or clinical details necessary to form a differential diagnosis are not included in the content. However, I will list five potential differential diagnoses for transient amnesia in an elderly patient based on common etiologies:

1. Transient ischemic attack (TIA) (confidence level: 85%) - Given the patient's age, a TIA could present with transient amnesia, especially if it involves the posterior circulation affecting the thalamus or temporal lobes.
2. Mild cognitive impairment or early dementia (confidence level: 75%) - Transient amnesia could be an early sign of a neurodegenerative process.
3. Seizure activity, particularly transient epileptic amnesia (confidence level: 70%) - Seizures can cause transient memory disturbances.
4. Psychogenic amnesia (confidence level: 65%) - Psychological factors can sometimes cause transient amnesia, though this is less common.
5. Metabolic disturbances (e.g., hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance) (confidence level: 80%) - Metabolic issues can lead to transient neurological symptoms, including amnesia.

After reviewing the additional content from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05212012comp/tab-legends, which unfortunately does not provide further information or imaging findings, the differential diagnoses cannot be revised. To provide a more accurate differential diagnosis, specific imaging findings or additional clinical details would be necessary.

Without additional information, the confidence levels remain speculative based on the general presentation of transient amnesia in an elderly patient. Further clinical evaluation and imaging would be required to refine the differential diagnosis and confidence levels.",85,Insufficient
2012,Transient Global Amnesia,"Based on the initial content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05212012, an 84-year-old man presents with transient amnesia. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for this presentation:

1. Transient Global Amnesia (TGA) (confidence level: 90%)
2. Transient ischemic attack (TIA) affecting the hippocampus (confidence level: 80%)
3. Seizure with postictal state (confidence level: 75%)
4. Early-stage neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease (confidence level: 70%)
5. Metabolic encephalopathy (e.g., hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance) (confidence level: 65%)

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/05212012/tab-legends, which describe an axial diffusion-weighted image (DWI) and corresponding FLAIR image demonstrating a focus of restricted diffusion in the region of the right hippocampus, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Transient Global Amnesia (TGA) (confidence level: 95%) - The imaging finding of a focus of restricted diffusion in the right hippocampus is characteristic of TGA, which can present with transient amnesia.
2. Acute ischemic stroke (confidence level: 85%) - A focus of restricted diffusion suggests acute ischemia, but the transient nature of the symptoms makes TGA more likely.
3. Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) encephalitis (confidence level: 70%) - HSV encephalitis can affect the temporal lobes and present with memory disturbances, but it typically has a more severe clinical course.
4. Seizure with postictal state (confidence level: 75%) - Seizures can cause transient amnesia and may show transient DWI changes in the hippocampus.
5. Limbic encephalitis (confidence level: 70%) - Limbic encephalitis can present with DWI changes in the medial temporal lobes and amnesia, but it is usually associated with additional clinical findings.

The confidence levels have been adjusted based on the imaging findings, which suggest a transient ischemic event in the hippocampus, with TGA being the most likely diagnosis given the clinical presentation and the imaging pattern of restricted diffusion in the hippocampus.",95,Excellent
2012,Unilateral Cerebellar Hypoplasia,"Based on the content provided from the American Journal of Neuroradiology at the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11192012, a 5-year-old boy presents with frequent falls, speech abnormalities, a significant past history of low birth weight and neonatal distress, ataxic gait, slurred speech, and plantar extensor reflex with exaggerated deep tendon reflexes on the left side. Here are five initial differential diagnoses for this presentation:

1. Cerebellar hypoplasia (confidence level: 90%)
2. Cerebral palsy (confidence level: 80%)
3. Ataxic dyskinetic cerebral palsy (confidence level: 75%)
4. Genetic or metabolic disorder affecting the cerebellum (e.g., ataxia-telangiectasia) (confidence level: 70%)
5. Post-infectious or post-inflammatory cerebellitis (confidence level: 65%)

After reviewing the additional imaging findings from the link https://www.ajnr.org/content/cow/11192012/tab-legends, which describe right-sided cerebellar hypoplasia on axial T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and coronal phase-sensitive inversion recovery sequence (PSIR), with the rest of the visualized brain appearing unremarkable and normal caliber and flow-void of the right vertebral artery, the differential diagnoses can be revised as follows:

1. Cerebellar hypoplasia (confidence level: 95%) - The imaging findings of right-sided cerebellar hypoplasia are consistent with the clinical presentation of ataxia and speech abnormalities.
2. Dandy-Walker malformation (confidence level: 85%) - This condition can present with cerebellar hypoplasia, but other characteristic features such as cystic dilation of the fourth ventricle are not mentioned.
3. Chiari malformation (confidence level: 80%) - Chiari malformations can cause cerebellar symptoms, but the imaging findings would typically show hindbrain herniation.
4. Genetic or metabolic disorder affecting the cerebellum (e.g., ataxia-telangiectasia) (confidence level: 75%) - These disorders can present with cerebellar hypoplasia and associated neurological deficits.
5. Focal cerebellar dysplasia (confidence level: 70%) - Focal underdevelopment of the cerebellum could explain the unilateral findings, but it is less common than global cerebellar hypoplasia.

The confidence levels have been adjusted based on the imaging findings, which specifically indicate right-sided cerebellar hypoplasia, making this the most likely diagnosis given the patient's symptoms and history. The other conditions are considered less likely but are included as differentials due to the need to consider all possible causes of the patient's clinical and imaging findings.",95,Excellent
